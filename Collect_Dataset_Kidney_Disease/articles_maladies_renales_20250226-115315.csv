PubMed,[Difelikefalin and treatment of severe pruritus associated with chronic kidney disease Real-life retrospective study in a dialysis center].,"Difelikefalin is to date the first and only specific treatment to be approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP) in adult patients on hemodialysis. This was a retrospective, single-center, real-life study in hemodialysis patients with CKD-aP treated with difelikefalin. The primary objective was to evaluate the evolution of the intensity of pruritus during treatment with difelikefalin using the Worst Itch Intensity-Numerical Rating Scale (WI-NRS). Adult patients were included if they had been on hemodialysis for at least 3 months and were suffering from moderate to severe CKD-aP (objectified by the WI-NRS score) for which difelikefalin had been prescribed. 11 patients (7 men and 4 women; mean age, 63.8 years) with a mean (SD) weekly dialysis time of 13 h (2.4) were included. The mean hemodialysis duration was 5 (3.6) years and the mean pruritus duration was 4.3 (3.2) years. At inclusion, on-going treatments of CKD-aP were emollients in all patients and antihistamines in 9 patients. The mean WI-NRS score was 7.4 (1.1) at initiation of difelikefalin. At last assessment after a median follow-up of 9.0 months, the mean change of WI-NRS score was -5.1 (2.9) and 82% of patients had a decrease ≥ 3 points. Mild to moderate adverse reactions to difelikefalin were reported in 4 patients, all of whom recovered without sequelae. These results show that difelikefalin, prescribed according to its therapeutic indication, is effective in the treatment of CKD-aP under real-life conditions, outside the controlled conditions of a clinical trial. La difélikéfaline est à ce jour le premier et le seul traitement spécifique approuvé pour le traitement du prurit d’intensité modérée à sévère associé à la maladie rénale chronique (Pa-MRC) chez les patients adultes hémodialysés. Il s’agit d’une étude rétrospective, monocentrique, en vie réelle, chez des patients hémodialysés souffrant de Pa-MRC et traités par difélikéfaline. L’objectif principal était d’évaluer l’évolution de l’intensité du prurit au cours du suivi à l’aide de l’échelle WI-NRS (Worst Itch Intensity-Numerical Rating Scale). Les patients adultes ont été inclus s’ils étaient hémodialysés depuis au moins trois mois et souffraient d’un Pa-MRC modéré à sévère (objectivé par le score WI-NRS) pour lequel la difélikéfaline avait été prescrite. Onze patients (7 hommes et 4 femmes ; âge moyen : 63,8 ans) avec un temps de dialyse hebdomadaire moyen (SD) de 13 heures (2,4) ont été inclus. La durée moyenne d’hémodialyse était de 5 ans (3,6) et la durée moyenne de prurit de 4,3 ans (3,2). À l’inclusion, les traitements du prurit en cours étaient des émollients pour tous les patients et des antihistaminiques pour 9 d’entre eux. Le score WI-NRS moyen était de 7,4 (1,1) au début du traitement par la difélikéfaline. À la dernière évaluation, après un suivi médian de 9 mois, la variation moyenne du score WI-NRS était de -5,1 (2,9) et 82 % des patients avaient une diminution ≥ 3 points. Des effets indésirables d’intensité légère à modérée liés à la difélikéfaline ont été rapportés chez 4 patients, tous rétablis sans séquelles. Ces résultats montrent que la difélikéfaline, prescrite conformément à son indication thérapeutique, est efficace en vie réelle dans le traitement du Pa-MRC, en dehors des conditions contrôlées d’un essai clinique.",Nephrologie & therapeutique,2024,Brasme Rémi; Cartery Claire; Goubet Marlène; Hennino Marie-Flore; Maisonneuve Nathalie,"Humans; Pruritus; Female; Male; Retrospective Studies; Middle Aged; Renal Dialysis; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Aged; Severity of Illness Index; Treatment Outcome",10.1684/ndt.2024.78,39917796,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39917796/

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a replacement therapy for patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD5). Its use varies from country to country. In France, only 11% of CKD5 patients are treated with PD, with great disparity between regions, the majority being supported with center hemodialysis (HD). Yet this treatment offers many advantages. It is a home-based treatment, allowing greater autonomy, and easy for patients to learn. In the event of incapacity, assistance can be provided by a nurse or a relative. No vascular approach is required. Its effectiveness in terms of patient survival is at least identical to that of HD patients. It is vital that all patients at MRC4 or 5 stage should be managed within the care pathway recommended by Haute Autorité de santé, so that they can benefit, among other things, from informed pre-dialysis information on the different dialysis modalities.

PubMed,[Association between iron deficiency and risk of major events in chronic kidney disease].,"Iron deficiency (ID) is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) but remains under-diagnosed and its prognosis poorly documented in the absence of anemia. The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between ID and the risk of major adverse outcomes in patients with CKD. Using data from the French Chronic Kidney Disease - Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (CKD-REIN) cohort which included and followed over five years, 3,033 patients with CKD stages 2 to 5 CKD, we estimated the prevalence of ID, defined by a ferritin level < 100 μg/L and/or a transferrin saturation < 20%, and associated hazard ratios (HR) of kidney failure with replacement therapy, kidney failure defined by an eGFR < 15 mL/min per 1.73 m2 or initiation of kidney replacement therapy, all-cause mortality, and death or hospitalization for heart failure. Baseline prevalence of ID in the cohort (66% men; mean age 67 ± 13 years) was 50% (48-52). Mean hemoglobin was 13 ± 1.7 g/dL, and only 31% of patients with ID also had a hemoglobin < 12 g/dL. In 2,803 patients with CKD stages 2-4 at baseline, ID was associated with significant increased risk of kidney failure, and of kidney failure with replacement therapy, with HRs adjusted for confounders and hemoglobin level of 1.22 (1.03-1.45) and 1.57 (1.27-1.94), respectively. Adjusted HRs for all-cause mortality and hospitalization or death for heart failure, were 1.31 (1.04-1.66) and 1.38 (1.07-1.80), respectively. This study shows that ID is significantly associated with the risk for kidney failure, all-cause mortality, and heart failure, independent of the presence of anemia. La carence martiale (CM) est fréquente chez les patients atteints de maladie rénale chronique (MRC), mais reste sous-diagnostiquée et son pronostic mal documenté en l’absence d’anémie.

PubMed,Screening and Diagnosis of Chronic Kidney Disease in Adults Living With Diabetes: A Retrospective Cohort Study Using the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network.,"In Canada, regional evaluations of screening practices for chronic kidney disease (CKD) among people with diabetes highlight areas for improvement; however, national estimates are notably absent. Estimates of CKD incidence often discount the expected decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) associated with age; age-adaptive thresholds may help account for this. We describe the frequency of screening and diagnosis of CKD among adults with diabetes from a nationally representative primary care cohort. In this retrospective cohort study, we used electronic medical record data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network. We followed adult patients (≥18 years of age) with diabetes without CKD at baseline for 5 years starting in 2014. We determined the frequency of urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACr) and/or eGFR testing over time. We identified incident CKD diagnoses based on eGFR measurements using fixed-threshold and age-adaptive definitions and quantified the incidence proportion and rate. We analyzed records from 37,604 patients with diabetes. Only 13% of patients had yearly eGFR and uACr testing for CKD, although roughly 60% had non-yearly use of both tests in 5 years. eGFR testing was performed more frequently than uACr testing (94.1% vs 76.6% having testing over follow-up). We found increased incidence proportions (14.6% vs 6.0%) and rates (33.1 vs 13.4 diagnoses per 1,000 person-years) of CKD using the fixed-threshold compared with age-adaptive definition.

PubMed,Haematological Indices and Iron Status in Pre-Dialysis Chronic Kidney Disease Patients.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with haematological changes, the commonest being anaemia. The number and function of white blood cells (WBC) and platelets are equally affected. Iron deficiency is a common cause of anaemia in the CKD population and anaemia has been associated with reduced cardiac function, increased rates of hospitalization, morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to determine the haematological indices and iron status among pre-dialysis CKD patients. A hospital-based cross-sectional study involving 95 predialysis CKD patients and 95 age- and sex-matched apparently healthy controls. Full blood count, peripheral blood film, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, C-reactive protein (CRP), electrolytes, urea and creatinine, serum folate and vitamin B12 were done in all study participants. Comparisons were made between results obtained from participants in both groups. The mean ages were 58.1 ± 14.9 years and 58.3 ± 15.0 years in the CKD group and controls, respectively. The male:female ratio was 1:0.9 in both groups. The prevalence of anaemia was 51.6% and 3% in patients with CKD and controls, respectively. There was no significant difference in the total WBC count, neutrophil and lymphocyte differentials, platelet count, serum vitamin B12 and folate in patients with CKD and controls. The prevalence of iron deficiency among patients with CKD was 32.6%, of which 62.5% were absolutely iron-deficient while 37.5% were functionally iron-deficient. The median ferritin and CRP were also higher in CKD. (p =0.001). Anaemia and iron deficiency are common in predialysis CKD patients. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to avoid the problems associated with them.

PubMed,[Diagnosis and management of pruritus associated with chronic kidney disease in hemodialyzed patients].,"Chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP) is a disabling symptom which is frequent and often underestimated. Pa-MRC has a negative impact on quality of life, and is frequently accompanied by sleep disorders and depression. The approval of difelikefalin – a kappa opioid receptor agonist – in this indication requires updated recommendations. As a first step, secondary causes of pruritus without skin lesions must be ruled out, and general measures taken (emollients, psychological support, optimization of dialysis, normalization of serum calcium, phosphate and PTH in the range proposed by the KGIDO guidelines, treatment of iron deficiency). A therapeutic test with a non-sedating oral antihistamine may be proposed. If this test is negative, Pa-MRC must be strongly suspected, and its intensity (WI-NRS scale) and impact on quality of life assessed. In the case of mild Pa-MRC (WI-NRS ≤ 3), only general measures are implemented. If Pa-MRC is moderate to severe (WI-NRS ≥ 4), specific treatment with difelikefaline can be initiated for 6 months in addition to general measures. At 3 months, if the response is complete (WI-NRS score ≤ 1) or partial (decline ≥ 3 points), treatment is continued. At 6 months, if the response is complete, treatment may be discontinued with the patient’s agreement; treatment is maintained if the response is partial. At 3 or 6 months, if response is insufficient (decline < 3 points) and/or in the event of intolerance, treatment is discontinued and an alternative treatment (e.g., gabapentinoids, UVB) may be considered after dermatological consultation. Le prurit associé à la maladie rénale chronique (Pa-MRC) est un symptôme invalidant qui est fréquent et souvent sous-estimé. Le Pa-MRC a des conséquences négatives sur la qualité de vie et s’accompagne fréquemment de troubles du sommeil et de dépression. L’approbation de la difélikéfaline – agoniste des récepteurs opioïdes kappa – dans cette indication nécessite l’actualisation des recommandations. Les causes secondaires de prurit sans lésions cutanées doivent être exclues et des mesures générales doivent être prises (émollients, aide psychologique, optimisation de la dialyse, équilibre phosphocalcique avec parathormone [PTH] dans la cible KDIGO [Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes], traitement de la carence martiale). Une épreuve thérapeutique avec un antihistaminique oral non sédatif peut être proposée. En cas de test négatif, il faut fortement suspecter un Pa-MRC et évaluer son intensité (échelle WI-NRS [Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale]) et son impact sur la qualité de vie. En cas de Pa-MRC léger (WI-NRS ≤ 3), seules les mesures générales sont mises en œuvre. Si le Pa-MRC est modéré à sévère (WI-NRS ≥ 4), un traitement spécifique par difélikéfaline peut être instauré pour 6 mois en plus des mesures générales. À 3 mois, si la réponse est complète (score WI-NRS ≤ 1) ou partielle (baisse ≥ 3 points), le traitement est poursuivi. À 6 mois, si la réponse est complète, l’arrêt du traitement peut être envisagé avec l’accord du patient ; il est maintenu en cas de réponse partielle. À 3 ou 6 mois, en cas de réponse insuffisante (baisse < 3 points) et/ou d’intolérance, le traitement est interrompu et un autre traitement (par exemple, gabapentinoïdes, ultraviolet de type B [UVB]) peut être envisagé après avis dermatologique.",Nephrologie & therapeutique,2024,Lanot Antoine; Misery Laurent; Rostoker Guy; Testa Angelo; Chauveau Philippe; Touzot Maxime; Florens Nans; Bataille Pierre,"Humans; Quality of Life; Pruritus; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Renal Dialysis",10.1684/ndt.2024.60,38294264,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38294264/
PubMed,"Pregnancy outcomes in women with primary Sjögren's syndrome: an analysis of data from the multicentre, prospective, GR2 study.","Adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with primary Sjögren's syndrome have only been evaluated retrospectively using heterogeneous methods and with contradictory results. We aimed to describe adverse pregnancy, delivery, and birth outcome risks in pregnant women with primary Sjögren's syndrome compared with those of a matched general population in France, and to identify factors predictive of disease flares or adverse pregnancy outcomes. We conducted a multicentre, prospective, cohort study in France using the GR2 (Groupe de Recherche sur la Grossesse et les Maladies Rares) registry. Women from the GR2 study were eligible if they had conceived before March, 2021, had primary Sjögren's syndrome according to the American College of Rheumatology and European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) 2016 classification criteria, and had an ongoing pregnancy at 12 weeks of gestation. In women who entered in the registry with pregnancies before 18 weeks of gestation, we sought to identify factors associated with primary Sjögren's syndrome flare (≥3-point increase in EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index [ESSDAI] score) or adverse pregnancy outcomes (fetal or neonatal death, placental insufficiency leading to a preterm delivery [<37 weeks of gestation], or small-for-gestational-age birthweight). A matched controlled study compared adverse pregnancy, delivery, and birth outcome rates between pregnant women with primary Sjögren's syndrome from the GR2 registry and matched controls from the general population included in the last French perinatal survey (Enquête Nationale Périnatale 2016). 1944 pregnancies were identified in the GR2 cohort, of which 106 pregnancies in 96 women with primary Sjögren's syndrome were included in this analysis. The median age at pregnancy onset was 33 years (IQR 31-36). 87 (83%) of 105 pregnancies (with ethnicity data) were in White women, 18 (17%) were in Black women; 92 (90%) of 102 had previous systemic activity (ESSDAI score of ≥1; data missing in four pregnancies), and 48 (45%) of 106 had systemic activity at inclusion. Of 93 pregnancies included at week 18 of gestation or earlier, primary Sjögren's syndrome flares occurred in 12 (13%). No baseline parameters were associated with primary Sjögren's syndrome flare. Four twin pregnancies and one medical termination were excluded from the adverse pregnancy outcome analysis; of the remaining 88, adverse pregnancy outcomes occurred in six (7%). Among pregnancies in women with data for antiphospholipid antibodies (n=55), antiphospholipid antibody positivity was more frequent among pregnancies with adverse outcomes (two [50%] of four pregnancies) compared with those without adverse outcomes (two [4%] of 51 pregnancies; p=0·023). Anti-RNP antibody positivity was also more frequent among pregnancies with adverse outcomes than those without, although this was not statistically significant. In the matched controlled study, adverse pregnancy outcomes occurred in nine (9%) of 105 pregnancies in women with primary Sjögren's syndrome and 28 (7%) of the 420 matched control pregnancies; adverse pregnancy outcomes were not significantly associated with primary Sjögren's syndrome (odds ratio 1·31, 95% CI 0·53-2·98; p=0·52). Pregnancies in women with primary Sjögren's syndrome had very good prognoses for mothers and fetuses, with no overall increase in adverse pregnancy outcome risk compared with the general population. Women with antiphospholipid antibodies or anti-RNP antibodies require close monitoring, because these factors might be associated with a higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Its prevalence is high, but under-reported by patients and those living with the disease, as it is silent and asymptomatic in the early stages. Kidney disease increases the risk of heart and vascular disease. These problems can manifest themselves slowly, over a long period of time. Early detection and treatment can often prevent chronic kidney disease from worsening. As kidney disease progresses, it can lead to kidney failure, requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant to stay alive. In this narrative review, we will mainly discuss different treatment option costs in different countries and how much they cost healthcare systems in countries in three different continents.",Annales pharmaceutiques francaises,2024,Mourchid Rania; Yassine Amal; Bellahcen Mohammed; Cherrah Yahia; Serragui Samira,"Humans; Renal Dialysis; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Africa; Health Care Costs; Asia",10.1016/j.pharma.2024.01.002,38218427,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38218427/
PubMed,"[Finerenone (Kerendia®), a new weapon against the chronic kidney disease of a patient with type 2 diabetes].","Finerenone, a new nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, showed a significant reduction in a primary composite renal outcome in FIDELIO-DKD and a significant reduction in a primary composite cardiovascular outcome in FIGARO-DKD in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and a chronic kidney disease (CKD). In a subsequent analysis that combined these two clinical trials (FIDELITY), the reduction becomes statistically significant when compared to placebo for both outcomes, with a hazard ratio of 0.86 (95 % confidence interval 0.78-0.95; P = 0.0018) for the cardiovascular outcome and 0.77 (0.67-0.88; P = 0.0002) for the renal outcome. Furthermore, all renal events occurred less frequently with finerenone than with placebo, including the progression to end-stage CKD independently of the baseline levels of glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria and regardless of associated medications (including gliflozins). The safety profile was excellent. However, a significant increase in serum potassium level was observed. Even if it is less pronounced than the increase usually seen with spironolactone, the risk of hyperkalemia requires some caution regarding both patient selection and monitoring. Finerenone (Kerendia®) is indicated in the treatment of CKD with albuminuria in adult patients with T2D. In Belgium, it is reimbursed with conditions in combination with a renin-angiotensin blocker. La finérénone, un nouvel antagoniste non stéroïdien du récepteur des minéralocorticoïdes, a montré, dans deux grandes études réalisées chez des patients avec un diabète de type 2 (DT2) et une maladie rénale chronique (MRC), une réduction significative du critère composite rénal dans FIDELIO-DKD et du critère composite cardiovasculaire dans FIGARO-DKD. Dans une analyse combinant les deux études (FIDELITY), la réduction est statistiquement significative dans le groupe finérénone par rapport au groupe placebo pour les deux critères, avec un hasard ratio de 0,86 (intervalle de confiance à 95 % 0,78-0,95; P = 0,0018) pour le critère cardiovasculaire et de 0,77 (0,67-0,88; P = 0,0002) pour le critère rénal.

PubMed,[Cognitive impairment and the blood-brain barrier in chronic kidney disease: role of the uremic toxins].,"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of cognitive disorders, presenting as vascular dementia, compared with the general population. These cognitive disorders occur early during the course of the kidney disease and evolve in parallel with the decline in glomerular filtration rate. They affect 30 to 80 % of patients with stage 5 CKD. Kidney transplantation only partially improves cognitive impairment. In this narrative review, we summarize the epidemiology and recent clinical and experimental data on cognitive impairment in CKD and discuss the potential specific mechanisms. Among the factors associated with cognitive impairment, the accumulation of uremic toxins such as indoxyl sulfate appears to be a specific risk factor for cognitive decline. These toxins have an endothelial toxicity that can disrupt the cerebral endothelium. The rupture of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a mechanism implicated in several neurodegenerative pathologies and systemic diseases with cerebral tropism. Recent experimental findings in CKD indicate that disruption of the BBB appears to be an important mechanism behind cognitive impairment in CKD. In murine models of CKD, increased BBB permeability is linked to memory impairment and aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation following accumulation of circulating indoxyl sulfate. This disruption of the BBB could also have harmful consequences for stroke susceptibility and drug neurotoxicity in CKD patients. Les patients atteints de maladie rénale chronique (MRC) présentent un risque accru de troubles neurocognitifs par rapport à la population générale, se présentant sous la forme d’une démence vasculaire. Ces troubles cognitifs interviennent précocement dans la maladie rénale et évoluent en parallèle au déclin du débit de filtration glomérulaire. Ils concernent 30 à 80 % des patients au stade 5 de la MRC. La transplantation rénale n’améliore que partiellement les troubles cognitifs. Dans cette revue narrative, nous résumons l’épidémiologie et les données cliniques et expérimentales récentes sur les troubles cognitifs dans la MRC, et nous en abordons les mécanismes spécifiques potentiels. Parmi les facteurs associés aux atteintes cognitives, l’accumulation des toxines urémiques, comme l’indoxyl sulfate, apparaît comme un facteur de risque spécifique de déclin cognitif. Ces toxines possèdent une toxicité endothéliale pouvant perturber l’endothélium cérébral. La rupture de la barrière hémato-encéphalique (BHE) est un mécanisme impliqué dans plusieurs pathologies neuro-dégénératives et des maladies systémiques à tropisme cérébral. Les résultats de travaux expérimentaux récents dans la MRC indiquent que la rupture de la BHE semble être un mécanisme important des troubles cognitifs au cours de la MRC. Dans les modèles murins de MRC, la perméabilité accrue de la BHE est liée à l’atteinte de la mémoire et à l’activation d’Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor suite à l’accumulation d’indoxyl sufate circulant. Cette rupture de la BHE pourrait également avoir des conséquences néfastes sur la susceptibilité aux accidents vasculaires cérébraux (AVC) et à la neurotoxicité médicamenteuse chez les patients MRC.",Nephrologie & therapeutique,2023,Bobot Mickaël,"Humans; Mice; Animals; Blood-Brain Barrier; Uremic Toxins; Indican; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Cognitive Dysfunction; Toxins, Biological; Uremia",10.1684/ndt.2023.51,38059844,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38059844/

PubMed,[Pruritus associated with chronic kidney disease in hemodialysis patients: a survey in French nephrologists].,"Chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP) is common in hemodialysis patients and severely impairs their quality of life, but the practices of nephrologists remain poorly known. The objective of this on-line survey was to describe the management of CKD-aP in French nephrologists affiliated with the French-speaking Society of Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplantation (SFNDT) and involved in hemodialysis. In total, 122 questionnaires were completed and 100 were usable. Nephrologists reported they personally managed a median of 52 patients; they estimated that the CKD-aP prevalence in their hemodialysis patients was a median of 10% (IQR, 6.3-17.2); 6% of nephrologists reported not following any patient with CKD-aP. In case of CKD-aP, the first-intention intervention was the evaluation of phosphocalcic metabolism (53.5%) and verification of dialysis adequacy (52%). For moderate-to-severe CKD-aP, the first-line prescription was topical therapy (71.3%), antihistamine (23.2%) and membrane change (15.9%). Patients were referred to a dermatologist mainly in case of treatment failure (86.9%) or scratching lesions (40.4%). Available treatments were considered ineffective for 50.5% of nephrologists, partially effective for 45.5% and effective for only 4%. These results show that according to the opinion of nephrologists, the pruritus prevalence is low in dialysis patients. This is inconsistent with studies based on systematic patient interviews, thus suggesting that pruritus is a symptom overlooked by nephrologists. In the context of the arrival of a new drug for pruritus, patients should be more questioned about this symptom in order to propose this treatment. Le prurit associé à l’insuffisance rénale chronique (Pa-IRC) est fréquent chez les patients hémodialysés et altère gravement leur qualité de vie, mais les pratiques des néphrologues restent mal connues. L’objectif de cette enquête en ligne était de décrire la prise en charge du Pa-IRC par les néphrologues français hémodialyseurs affiliés à la Société francophone de néphrologie, dialyse et transplantation (SFNDT).

En cas de Pa-IRC, l’intervention de première intention était l’évaluation du métabolisme phosphocalcique (53,5 %) et la vérification de la qualité de dialyse (52 %). Pour le Pa-IRC modéré à sévère, la prescription de première intention était un traitement topique (71,3 %), un antihistaminique (23,2 %) et un changement de membrane (15,9 %). Les traitements disponibles étaient considérés comme inefficaces pour 50,5 % des néphrologues, partiellement efficaces pour 45,5 % et efficaces pour seulement 4 %. Ces résultats montrent que selon l’opinion des néphrologues, la prévalence du prurit est faible chez les patients dialysés. Ceci est en contradiction avec les études basées sur des entretiens systématiques avec les patients, suggérant ainsi que le prurit est un symptôme sous-estimé par les néphrologues.

The main objective of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of constipation in CKD patients. We conducted a retrospective multicenter data-driven study. 74 patient records were analyzed. We found a prevalence of constipation of 58&#160;% in patients with CKD. Our results showed that the prevalence of constipation is frequent in patients with CKD. It leads to a significant discomfort for the patient, an additional cost in terms of care and technical procedures and a failure of the peritoneal dialysis technique. Thus, the prevention of constipation in CKD patients would be relevant to limit complications and ensure a better quality of life.

On the issue of survival of ESKD patients, the following key messages were retained. The annual mortality rates of ESKD patients are relatively stable even though patients are ageing and increasingly have diabetes or obesity. These changes are probably linked to improved practices. Cardiovascular diseases and infections are the main causes of death. The year 2020 was marked by an increase in mortality due to the SARS-CoV-19 infection that was particularly severe in these patients.

Les taux de mortalité annuels des patients en IRCT sont relativement stables alors même que les patients vieillissent et qu’ils sont de plus en plus souvent porteurs d’un diabète ou d’une obésité. Ces évolutions sont probablement en lien avec une amélioration des pratiques. Les maladies cardiovasculaires et les infections représentent les causes principales de décès.

PubMed,Frailty and sarcopenia metabolomic signatures in kidney transplant candidates: the FRAILMar study.,"Sarcopenia and frailty are often overlooked in assessing kidney transplant (KT) candidates with chronic kidney disease (CKD), potentially leading to poor post-transplant outcomes. This study aimed to identify metabolites associated with frailty and sarcopenia in KT candidates from the FRAILMar study. Between June 2016 and June 2020, we evaluated frailty and sarcopenia in 173 KT candidates using the Physical Frailty Phenotype and EGWSOP-2 criteria, respectively. Seventy-five metabolic markers from targeted pathways, previously linked to CKD, sarcopenia or frailty, were measured in serum samples. These markers were analyzed using adjusted and weighted generalized linear models. Metabolomic data were integrated with multi-modal data, such as comorbidities, using a factor-based integration algorithm to identify metabolic phenotypes. Increased metabolites related to energy metabolism and essential amino acids were associated with frailty, mainly Krebs cycle intermediates. Sarcopenic KT candidates showed lower levels of aromatic amino acids, and lower protein/muscle metabolism, energy metabolism and neurotransmission compared with non-sarcopenic patients. Unsupervised multi-modal integration revealed a high-risk metabolic phenotype characterized by the presence of sarcopenia, diabetes mellitus and low body mass index, with alterations in branched-chain amino acids and high activity of lactate dehydrogenase enzyme.

PubMed,The evaluation of kidney transplant candidates prior to waitlisting: a scoping review.,"Before patients with kidney failure can undergo kidney transplantation, their suitability is assessed through a transplantation work-up. Variation in the transplantation work-up could contribute to inefficiency and inequality in accessing the transplant waiting list and kidney transplantation. We conducted a scoping review on the evaluation of kidney transplant candidates prior to waitlisting, investigating: (i) content of the transplantation work-up; (ii) contraindications to waitlisting; and (iii) organization of the transplantation work-up. A systematic search was conducted in Ovid Medline and Ovid EMBASE in collaboration with a medical information specialist. Studies investigating practice patterns since 2013 related to the evaluation of adults receiving their first kidney graft from a deceased donor were included. Results from 20 studies showed substantial variation in the evaluation of kidney transplant candidates. The content of the transplantation work-up differed between studied centers, yet common domains included screening for infections, heart disease, peripheral artery disease, and malignancy. Commonly reported contraindications to waitlisting were obesity and age-related factors. However, strict cut-off for BMI and age were used less. The organization of the transplantation work-up differed across studied centers with regard to referral and waitlisting decisions, screening and prioritization, and the setting of the transplantation work-up. Literature on the evaluation of kidney transplant candidates is limited, but our findings suggest substantial variation in pre-waitlisting practices among centers. This may contribute to differences in kidney transplantation access and outcomes between countries. Further research on pre-transplantation practices, specifically regarding the standardization of the transplantation work-up, is needed.",Clinical kidney journal,2025,Boerstra Brittany A; Pippias Maria; Kramer Anneke; Dirix Marie; Daams Joost; Jager Kitty J; Hellemans Rachel; Stel Vianda S,,10.1093/ckj/sfae377,40008352,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40008352/
PubMed,Multiparametric MRI: can we assess renal function differently?,"We are lacking tools to evaluate renal performance. In this review, we presented the current knowledge and potential future applications in nephrology of new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, focusing on diffusion-weighted (DWI) MRI, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) MRI, and magnetic resonance relaxometry (T1 and T2 mapping). These sequences are sensitive to early changes in biological processes such as perfusion, oxygenation, edema, or fibrosis without requiring contrast medium injection and avoids irradiation and nephrotoxicity. Combining these different sequences into the so-called ""multiparametric MRI"" enables noninvasive, repeated exploration of renal performance on each kidney separately. DWI MRI, which evaluates the movement of water molecules, is a promising tool for noninvasive assessment of interstitial fibrosis and the cortical restricted diffusion has a prognostic value for the deterioration of renal function in diabetic nephropathy. BOLD MRI is sensitive to changes in renal tissue oxygenation based on the paramagnetic properties of deoxyhemoglobin and is of particular interest in the setting of renal artery stenosis to assess tissue oxygenation in the post-stenotic kidney. This sequence can be used for predicting degradation of renal function in chronic kidney diseases (CKD) and might be useful in preclinical studies to assess nephroprotective and nephrotoxic effects of drugs in development. T1 and T2 relaxation times change with tissue water content and might help assessing renal fibrosis. A corticomedullary dedifferentiation in T1 has been observed in CKD and negatively correlates with glomerular filtration rate. Data on the significance of T2 values in renal imaging is more limited. Multiparametric MRI has the potential to provide a better understanding of renal physiology and pathophysiology, a better characterization of renal lesions, an earlier and more sensitive detection of renal disease, and an aid to personalized patient-centered therapeutic decision-making. Further data and clinical trials are needed to allow its routine application in clinical practice.",Clinical kidney journal,2025,Tournebize Corentin; Schleef Maxime; De Mul Aurélie; Pacaud Sophie; Derain-Dubourg Laurence; Juillard Laurent; Rouvière Olivier; Lemoine Sandrine,,10.1093/ckj/sfae365,40008350,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40008350/

PubMed,Nonlinear association between glycated hemoglobin levels and mortality in elderly patients with non-diabetic chronic kidney disease: a national health and nutrition examination survey analysis.,"The relationship between glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and mortality outcomes in elderly patients with non-diabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) has not been well characterized. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between HbA1c levels and all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in elderly individuals with non-diabetic CKD. Data from the NHANES (1999-2018) were analyzed to measure HbA1c levels in whole blood using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Information on deaths and subsequent details was collected through the National Mortality Index until December 31, 2019. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause and CVD mortality were calculated using weighted Cox proportional hazards and restricted cubic spline models. Among the 1,931 participants (mean [SE] age, 73.2 [0.2] years; 61.9% female), over a median follow-up period of 7.6 years, a total of 1,003 deaths were observed, including 412 from CVD. HbA1c was divided into four quartiles: Quartile 1 (3.7-5.3%), Quartile 2 (5.4-5.6%), Quartile 3 (5.7-5.8%) as the reference group, and Quartile 4 (5.9-6.4%). Higher risks of all-cause mortality were noted in the lowest and highest HbA1c quartiles, with adjusted HR (95% CI) of 1.48 (1.18-1.87) and 1.31 (1.01-1.70) respectively. For CVD mortality, the lowest quartile showed a significantly increased risk (HR 1.94, 95% CI: 1.29-2.90), but the highest quartile did not significantly differ from the reference, with HR 1.14 (0.73-1.77). The RCS analysis indicated a U-shaped nonlinear relationship between HbA1c levels and all-cause mortality (P = 0.026 for nonlinearity) and a J-shaped nonlinear relationship with CVD mortality (P = 0.035 for nonlinearity).

This study was undertaken to determine the incidence and associated risk factors and evaluate fetomaternal outcomes in PRAKI at tertiary care institution. A prospective longitudinal study was conducted with enrollment of pregnant females with PRAKI, ≥28 weeks, and up to 7 days of puerperium, diagnosed as per the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria - serum creatinine >1.3 mg/dl at admission or increased by 0.3 mg/dL within 48 h or >1.5 times within 7 days or urine output <0.5 ml/kg/h. A detailed history including sociodemographic factors, obstetric history, and underlying medical disorders with primary cause and obstetric precipitating factors of PRAKI was noted. The sample size was 184 patients and followed up with serial renal function test, serum electrolytes, input/urine output monitoring, and dialysis, on nephrologist advice.

PubMed,Plant-Dominant Low-Protein Diets: A Promising Dietary Strategy for Mitigating Disease Progression in People with Chronic Kidney Disease-A Comprehensive Review.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health crisis affecting over 10% of the population, with mortality rates increasing significantly. Current management strategies, including expensive medications and renal replacement therapies, highlight the need for cost-effective, conservative approaches. This review examines the evidence for plant-dominant low-protein diets (PLADO) in managing non-dialysis-dependent CKD. Existing guidelines for protein restriction in CKD vary considerably, with inconsistencies and a lack of personalization noted in the KDOQI and KDIGO recommendations. While traditional low-protein diet trials show limited success due to poor adherence and marginal benefits, PLADO offers a potentially more sustainable alternative.

PubMed,Benefits and Pitfalls of Uraemic Toxin Measurement in Peritoneal Dialysis.,"Chronic kidney disease is a global health burden with a rising incidence and prevalence in developed and developing nations. Once established, it results in a progressive accumulation of a myriad of uraemic toxins. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) uses the body's peritoneal membrane to remove these toxins across a semipermeable membrane to restore and maintain homeostasis. Traditionally, dialysis adequacy has been measured through clearance of urea and creatinine. However, numerous studies have shown marginal links comparing the clearance of urea and creatinine with clinical outcomes reflected in the recent changes to the ISPD guidelines on dialysis adequacy. Instead, attention has focused on protein-bound uraemic toxins (PBTs). Produced by gut bacteria, these molecules are highly protein-bound and poorly removed by either dialysis or absorptive agents. Elevated concentrations of molecules such as p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate have been associated with abnormal cellular function and poor patient outcomes. However, widespread use of these measures to determine dialysis adequacy has been limited by the need for specialized techniques required for measurement. Altering the gut microbiome to reduce generation of PBTs through increased dietary fiber might be an alternate approach to better patient outcomes, with some initial positive reports. This report explores advantages and limitations of measuring uraemic toxins in PD, now and in the foreseeable future.",Journal of clinical medicine,2025,Malaweera Aruni; Huang Louis; McMahon Lawrence,,10.3390/jcm14041395,40004925,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40004925/

The key elements of the diagnostic process are presented. The role of renal biopsy is discussed, as it appears to be underused in relation to the expected benefits. Renal biopsy allows ICI to be continued if AKI is not related to AKI.

PubMed,Association between postoperative hypotension and acute kidney injury after noncardiac surgery: a historical cohort analysis.,"The extent to which postoperative hypotension contributes to renal injury remains unclear, much less what the harm thresholds might be. We therefore tested the primary hypothesis that there is an absolute hypotensive arterial pressure threshold for acute kidney injury during the initial seven days after noncardiac surgery. We conducted a single-centre historical cohort analysis of adults who had noncardiac surgery and had creatinine recorded preoperatively and postoperatively. Our exposure was the lowest postoperative mean arterial pressure, defined as the average of the three lowest postoperative pressure measurements. Our primary analysis was the association between the lowest mean arterial pressure and acute kidney injury, defined according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes initiative criteria. Our analysis was adjusted for potentially relevant confounding factors including intraoperative hypotension. Among 64,349 patients analyzed, 2,812 (4.4%) patients had postoperative acute kidney injury. Each 5-mm Hg decrease in the lowest mean arterial pressure was associated with a 28% (97.5% confidence interval [CI], 23 to 32; P < 0.001) increase in the odds of acute kidney injury for lowest mean arterial pressures < 80 mm Hg. Higher lowest pressures were not associated with acute kidney injury (odds ratio, 1.08; 97.5% CI, 0.99 to 1.17; P = 0.04) for each 5-mm Hg decrease in the lowest mean arterial pressure. Postoperative hypotension, defined as the lowest postoperative mean arterial pressure < 80 mm Hg, was associated with acute kidney injury after noncardiac surgery. A prospective trial will be required to determine whether the observed association is causal and thus amenable to modification. RéSUMé: OBJECTIF: Nous ne savons pas dans quelle mesure l’hypotension postopératoire contribue aux lésions rénales, et nous connaissons encore moins les seuils de lésion. Nous avons donc testé l’hypothèse primaire selon laquelle il existerait un seuil absolu de tension artérielle hypotensive pour l’insuffisance rénale aiguë au cours des sept premiers jours suivant une chirurgie non cardiaque. MéTHODE: Nous avons mené une analyse de cohorte historique monocentrique auprès d’adultes ayant bénéficié d’une chirurgie non cardiaque et pour lesquel·les les taux de créatinine avant et après l’opération avaient été enregistrés. Notre exposition était la tension artérielle moyenne postopératoire la plus basse, définie comme la moyenne des trois mesures de tension postopératoire les plus basses. Notre analyse principale a porté sur l’association entre la tension artérielle moyenne la plus basse et l’insuffisance rénale aiguë, définies selon les critères de l’initiative KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes). Notre analyse a été ajustée pour tenir compte des facteurs de confusion potentiellement pertinents, notamment de l’hypotension peropératoire.

PubMed,Predictors of acute kidney injury after lung resection surgery: a retrospective case-control study.,"Patients undergoing lung resection are at increased risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) in the immediate postoperative period, with important consequences for longer term morbidity and mortality. Lung resection surgery has unique considerations that could increase the risk of AKI, including lung resection volume, duration of one-lung ventilation (OLV), and intraoperative fluid restriction. Yet, specific risk factor data are lacking. The objective of this study was to identify independent risk factors for early AKI after lung resection surgery. We conducted a retrospective case-control study of all patients presenting for elective lung resection surgery at an academic medical centre over a four-year period. Cases were patients who experienced an AKI and control patients were those who did not experience an AKI, based on KDIGO criteria. Baseline demographics and comorbidities along with duration of OLV and amount of lung resected were collected by retrospective chart review. The data were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression to identify independent predictors of AKI. Acute kidney injury occurred within 48 hr in 57/1,045 (5.5%; 95% confidence interval, 4.2 to 7.0) of patients. On multivariable analysis, our model of best fit included preoperative serum creatinine, male sex, use of angiotensin II receptor blockers, and duration of OLV. The rate of complications, intensive care unit admission, and risk of death were all higher in the group of patients who experienced AKI. Acute kidney injury occurs frequently after lung resection surgery and is associated with increased risk of postoperative complications. Increased duration of OLV may be a risk factor for AKI in this population.

Nephroprotection is not limited to nephrology and applies to all patients at risk of renal failure. Cancer patients are particularly at risk of developing intrinsic and extrinsic renal failure, as well as the toxicity of specific treatments. However, they are poorly included in nephroprotection studies. Thus, current guidelines have not been adapted to these pathologies and oncology-specific comorbidities, such as malnutrition or prognosis, are often not taken into account.

We conducted a quality improvement project in a satellite HD unit in London, Ontario, Canada, between August 1, 2019, and July 31, 2022. We assessed for baseline gaps in DM care among those with DM, performed root-cause analysis with key stakeholders to identify critical drivers of gaps, and conceptualized a certified diabetes educator-led outreach program to offer in the HD unit. We aimed to improve DM self-monitoring, hypo- and hyperglycemia, and DM-related screening. We used run and control charts to track outcome measures over time and modified our outreach program iteratively. Fifty-eight persons with DM receiving HD participated in our program. Support spanned multiple waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. With 4 tests of change, we observed improvement in DM self-monitoring with a modest decline in self-reported hyperglycemia. There were no adverse consequences, and satisfaction with our program was high.

PubMed,[Bee venom: an unusual cause of acute kidney injury].,"Bee sting venom is generally well tolerated. However, some rare cases of massive stings can lead to anaphylactic shock and even renal failure. This observation is the illustration of a case of acute kidney injury secondary to bee stings in a 64-year-old black african subject. A 64-year-old man without a known medical history was referred to the emergency department of the Fousseyni Daou hospital in Kayes (Mali) for disturbed consciousness 4 hours after massive stings from a bee swarm. Renal failure with serum creatinine level at 752,2 µmol/L was documented on day 3 in a context of total anuria. The patient was transferred to a nephrology unit and biology confirmed renal failure associated with intravascular haemolysis and rhabdomyolysis. The kidneys were of normal size and well differentiated. The diagnosis of severe acute kidney injury due to massive envenomation induced by bee venom was evoked. The evolution was favourable, with normalization of renal function at D26 after 5 sessions of haemodialysis in parallel with transfusions of packed red blood cells. A massive bee attack should be considered a medical emergency because of the organic damage it can inflict. The renal prognosis depends on the number of stings, and especially on the delay and the quality of the treatment. Early initiation of dialysis treatment reduces mortality.

PubMed,[Renal failure in multiple myeloma: Specific management issues].,"Renal impairment is common during multiple myeloma and persistent reduction in kidney function strongly affects prognosis. Cast nephropathy, by monoclonal free light chains precipitation with uromodulin in renal tubules, is the main cause of acute kidney injury in multiple myeloma. Kidney biopsy, although not necessary for diagnosis, allows assessment of renal prognosis according to the extent of cast formation, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Prevention and early diagnosis of acute kidney injury are essential to optimize management and avoid progression to chronic kidney disease. Rehydration, interruption of nephrotoxic treatments, correction of precipitating factors, anti-plasma cell chemotherapy can rapidly reduce the free light chains nephrotoxicity. The association of the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib and high dose Dexamethasone is the reference treatment in newly diagnosed patients with renal impairment. Adding Cyclophosphamide or the immunomodulator Lenalidomide may improve the hematological response, but with a poorer tolerance. Use of anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies is being evaluated in this population. Hemodialysis with high-flux or high-cut-off membranes, combined to chemotherapy, may improve renal function recovery.

PubMed,French practical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of AA amyloidosis.,"AA amyloidosis is secondary to the deposit of excess insoluble Serum Amyloid A (SAA) protein fibrils. AA amyloidosis complicates chronic inflammatory diseases, especially chronic inflammatory rheumatisms such as rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis; chronic infections such as tuberculosis, bronchectasia, chronic inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease; and auto-inflammatory diseases including familial Mediterranean fever. This work consists of the French guidelines for the diagnosis workup and treatment of AA amyloidosis. We estimate in France between 500 and 700 cases in the whole French population, affecting both men and women. The most frequent organ impaired is kidney which usually manifests by oedemas of the lower extremities, proteinuria, and/or renal failure. Patients are usually tired and can display digestive features anf thyroid goiter. The diagnosis of AA amyloidosis is based on detection of amyloid deposits on a biopsy using Congo Red staining with a characteristic green birefringence in polarized light. Immunohistochemical analysis with an antibody directed against Serum Amyloid A protein is essential to confirm the diagnosis of AA amyloidosis. Peripheral inflammatory biomarkers can be measured such as C Reactive protein and SAA. We propose an algorithm to guide the etiological diagnosis of AA amyloidosis. The treatement relies on the etiologic treatment of the undelying chronic inflammatory disease to decrease and/or normalize Serum Amyloid A protein concentration in order to stabilize amyloidosis. In case of renal failure, dialysis or even a kidney transplant can be porposed.

In case of resistance to medical treatment (native and active vitamin D, calcium and calcimimetics), surgical parathyroidectomy is indicated. The aim of this retrospective study is to show the evolution of the incidence and results of surgical parathyroidectomy in our center between 1980 and 2020 as patient characteristics, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies have changed. We collected data from dialysis patients who had a first surgical parathyroidectomy between 2000 and 2020 (period 2) in the same surgical department and compared them with historical data between 1980 and 1999 (period 1) operated in one other center. In period 1, 53 surgical parathyroidectomy were performed (2.78/year, 0 to 5, 8.5/1000 patients-year) vs.56 surgical parathyroidectomy in period 2 (2.8/year, 0 to 9, 8/1000 patients-year). The patients of the 2 periods were comparable except for the higher dialysis vintage in period 1 (149±170 vs.89±94 months; P=0.02). In comparison with dialysis patients not requiring surgical parathyroidectomy during the same period, patients who had surgical parathyroidectomy were younger, had higher dialysis vintage and lower diabetes prevalence, but more frequently carriers of glomerulopathy or polycystosis. Systematically performed in period 2, cervical ultrasound identified at least one visible gland in 78.6% of cases while the scintigraphy, performed only in 66% of cases, found at least one gland in 81% of cases. Twelve months after surgery, PTH > 300 pg/mL (marker of secondary hyperparathyroidism recurrence or surgery failure) was present in 30% of patients in period 1 vs. 5.3% in period 2. Hypoparathyroidism was also more frequently observed in period 2 (35.7 vs. 18.8%). Surgical complications were also higher in period 1. Despite therapeutic and strategic advances, severe secondary hyperparathyroidism is still as common as ever.

PubMed,The clinical characteristics and implications of acute kidney injury during induction therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia.,"Dual induction with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO) has made acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) a curable disease. However, differentiation syndrome (DS) can be a life-threatening complication of induction therapy. It is considered to result from a severe systemic inflammatory response mediated by increased expression of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules on differentiating blast cells. The kidney, as a vital organ rich in the capillary endothelium, could be targeted by differentiating blasts in DS. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a rare but severe consequence of DS secondary to ATRA and ATO induction and can result in renal failure and early mortality. Nevertheless, its clinical characteristics and impact on APL prognosis have yet to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics of DS-related AKI in patients with APL and its impact on patient prognosis. This was a retrospective study from a single center in a real-world setting. APL patients who developed AKI during ATRA- and ATO-based induction were included. The patients' clinical/laboratory data and outcome information were retrieved from the electronic medical records. From January 2011 to March 2024, a total of 26 out of 572 (4.5%) APL patients were identified as having AKI during dual induction. Among them, eight patients received continuous renal replacement therapy, and 3/8 patients experienced early death (ED), which was defined as death within 3 months of diagnosis. Among the five non-ED patients, three did not recover from renal function and were still dialysis-dependent during the follow-up. The estimated 2-year overall survival rate for all patients was 42%, and the ED rate was 30.8%. Survival analysis revealed that a greater tumor burden, a rapidly increasing WBC count, worse coagulation parameters, and persistent renal dysfunction were associated with a more adverse prognosis. AKI is a rare but severe complication of DS in the ATRA + ATO dual-induction era of APL. It is associated with a high ED rate and dismal long-term survival. Some patients develop irreversible renal dysfunction and become dialysis-dependent after leukemia remission. Thus, the management of AKI in APL patients is still a clinical challenge, and a deeper understanding of its pathogenesis, along with multidisciplinary efforts, is needed.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2025,Shen Kai; Yang Chenlu; Huang Jie; Shuai Xiao; Niu Ting; Ma Hongbing,,10.3389/fphar.2025.1540409,40008131,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40008131/

In most cases, these effects are subclinical but with potential underlying echocardiographic findings. Compared with grafts, arteriovenous fistulas are implicated more often, due to the progressively increased flow from the continuous dilatation of the venous outflow tract in the long term. The increasing flow is in the majority of patients well tolerated by cardiac adaptive alterations. However, the clinical impact is based on the balance between the amount of flow volume and the patient's cardiac reserves.

PubMed,PREVENTION OF COMPLICATIONS OF SURGICAL TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH OCCLUSION OF THE AORTOILIAC SEGMENT.,"The relevance of studying this topic is confirmed not only by the high incidence of aortoiliac segment occlusions, but also by the difficulty of preventing complications after surgical treatment. These complications can range from local infectious processes to serious systemic disorders such as renal failure, cardiovascular complications, and even death. to study the influence of concomitant pathologies on the outcome of surgical treatment with occlusion of the aortoiliac segment. Materias and methods. The study was conducted at the Semey Medical University. It was aimed at analyzing methods for minimizing complications in surgical treatment of patients suffering from aortoiliac segment occlusion. The study covered a wide range of aspects, from diagnostics to postoperative rehabilitation, and was implemented through a retrospective analysis of medical records of 300 patients who underwent open surgical treatment of this disease between September 2018 and September 2023. As part of a large clinical study, two groups of patients, each comprising 150 people, were compared. One group underwent preoperative drug correction of diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), while the other group continued to receive standard treatment without additional corrections. During the analysis of postoperative complications, it was found that in the group of patients who underwent preoperative correction of comorbidities, complications were observed in 27 patients, which accounted for 18% of the total number. In contrast, in the group without such correction, postoperative complications were recorded in 51 patients, which is equal to 34%. Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference in the incidence of complications between the two groups (p=0.005, t=2.82), confirming the importance of preoperative optimization in reducing the risk of postoperative complications. Complications that arose after surgery included infectious manifestations such as wound infections and pneumonia, cardiovascular problems including myocardial infarction and cardiac arrhythmias, and thrombotic complications including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE). For example, wound infections were observed in 13 cases among patients without correction and only in 6 cases among those who underwent correction. Pneumonia occurred in 19 cases in the non-corrected group and in 10 cases in the corrected group. These data indicate that preoperative optimization significantly reduces the risk of infectious complications after surgery. The study provided valuable data on the impact of preoperative preparation, including medical management of diabetes mellitus and COPD, on surgical outcomes in patients with aortoiliac occlusion. Based on the results, it can be concluded that careful preoperative assessment and preparation play a key role in reducing the risk of complications and improving clinical outcomes. In particular, preoperative correction of concomitant diseases significantly improves the condition of patients, as evidenced by higher functional test results, improved glycemic control, and decreased blood pressure. This, in turn, reduces the frequency and severity of intra- and postoperative complications, and reduces overall mortality. Analysis of predictors of complications showed that the duration of surgery and concomitant diabetes mellitus significantly increase the risk of postoperative complications. This emphasizes the need to develop and implement new surgical and anesthetic approaches aimed at optimizing the duration of operations and more careful monitoring of the condition of patients with diabetes. The results of the study also indicate the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of this category of patients, including vascular surgeons, anesthesiologists, therapists, endocrinologists, pulmonologists and other specialists. This allows for comprehensive preoperative preparation, adequate intraoperative management and high-quality postoperative monitoring. Overall, the results of this study provide a basis for the development of new treatment strategies for patients with aortoiliac segment occlusion aimed at improving clinical outcomes and quality of life of patients. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approaches and their implementation in clinical practice.",Georgian medical news,2024,Imanbayev M; Dyussupov A; Sabitov Y; Omarov N; Kazymov Y; Kozhakhmetov Zh; Toleutayeva D; Abdrakhmanov S; Akkaliyev M; Masalov A,"Humans; Postoperative Complications; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Iliac Artery; Arterial Occlusive Diseases; Aged; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive",,40007407,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40007407/

Osteoarthritis (OA), a common form of arthritis, has been shown to have a dramatically increased prevalence, particularly among individuals aged 40-50 and older, in the presence of CKD. Furthermore, CKD may exacerbate the progression and impact of OA. A survey study revealed that 53.9% of CKD patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis were diagnosed with OA. These findings underscore the potential association between CKD and OA. Uremic toxins, such as indoxyl sulfate, p-cresyl sulfate, transforming growth factor-β, and advanced glycation end-products, are regarded as potential risk factors in various CKD-related conditions, affecting bone and joint metabolism. However, whether these factors serve as a bridging mechanism between CKD and OA comorbidities, as well as their detailed roles in this context, remains unclear. Addressing the progression of OA in CKD patients and identifying effective treatment and prevention strategies is an urgent challenge that warrants immediate attention. This review focuses on describing and discussing the molecular pathological mechanisms underlying CKD-associated OA and the possible therapeutic strategies.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Yang Rong-Sen; Chan Ding-Cheng; Chung Yao-Pang; Liu Shing-Hwa,"Humans; Osteoarthritis; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Animals; Risk Factors; Uremic Toxins; Disease Progression",10.3390/ijms26041567,40004032,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40004032/

PubMed,Exploring the Utility of Renal Resistive Index in Critical Care: Insights into ARDS and Cardiac Failure.,"The renal resistive index (RRI), a Doppler ultrasound-derived parameter measuring renal vascular resistance, has emerged as a promising non-invasive tool to evaluate renal hemodynamics in critically ill patients, particularly those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and heart failure (HF). This narrative review examines the current evidence for RRI measurement in these conditions, exploring its physiological bases, methodology, clinical applications, and limitations. In ARDS, RRI reflects the complex interactions between positive pressure ventilation, hypoxemia, and systemic inflammation, showing a role in predicting acute kidney injury and monitoring response to interventions. In HF, RRI is able to assess venous congestion and cardiorenal interactions and can also serve as a prognostic indicator. Many studies have shown RRI's superiority or complementarity to traditional biomarkers in predicting renal dysfunction, although its interpretation requires consideration of multiple patient-related factors. Key challenges include operator dependency, lack of standardization, and complex interpretation in multi-organ dysfunction. Future research should focus on measurement standardization, development of automated techniques, investigation of novel applications like intraparenchymal renal resistive index variation, and validation of RRI-guided management strategies. Despite its limitations, RRI represents a valuable tool that offers bedside and real-time insights into renal hemodynamics and potential guidance for therapeutic interventions. Further research is needed to fully clarify its clinical potential and address current limitations, particularly in critical care settings involving multiple organ dysfunction.",Biomedicines,2025,Cuttone Giuseppe; Geraci Giulio; La Via Luigi; Sorbello Massimiliano; Pappalardo Federico; Carollo Caterina,,10.3390/biomedicines13020519,40002933,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40002933/

PubMed,The autonomic nervous system and bone health in chronic kidney disease.,"Besides the well-known role of hormonal factors in mineral and bone metabolism, the sympathetic nervous system participates in this regulation by inhibiting bone formation and promoting bone resorption, primarily via β-adrenergic receptors expressed on osteoblasts. Conversely, the parasympathetic system, through cholinergic signalling, inhibits osteoclast activity, promoting bone formation and maintaining skeletal homeostasis. This review presents the role of the autonomic nervous system, with particular focus on the potential role of β-blockers, especially β1-selective blockers, in modulating bone health in people with normal kidney function and those with CKD. While early studies with non-selective β-blockers like propranolol showed mixed results, recent findings in postmenopausal women suggested that β1-selective β-blockers could enhance bone density by modulating sympathetic activity.

PubMed,[“Junior Doctors” in Nephrology in France: first feedback].,"Medical education in France has undergone several major reforms in recent years. In 2017, the reform of the third cycle of medical studies was implemented. This particularly affected nephrology. The reform introduced a new status of “junior doctor”. Its main objective is to ensure the transition from intern to senior doctor. The “Syndicat National des Internes de Néphrologie” (SNIN) conducted a survey to take stock of this new status in our specialty. The respondents were contacted through their city referents. We received 53 completed questionnaires from Nephrology junior-doctors with an average age of 29 years from all over France. The choice of assignment was satisfactory in 93% of cases. The activity of these juniors-doctors was mainly oriented towards clinical nephrology or was mixed, with the possibility of own consultations for almost all residents. The on-call or nightshift activity of the junior-doctors was mainly concentrated in their home department, with only one third of them working as substitute. Their weekly working hours were substantial (mostly between 45 and 65 hours/week), with a significant number exceeding the legal limit. Overall, supervision was considered satisfactory. Very few residents had time for research or theorical-learning, although some gave lessons and received training mainly through conferences. Progress in performing renal biopsies was substantial, in contrast to central venous catheter placement and peritoneal dialysis management, where progress was judged to be weak. Les études médicales en France ont fait l’objet, au cours de ces dernières années, de plusieurs réformes profondes. En 2017, la réforme du troisième cycle des études médicales a été mise en application. Celle-ci concernait notamment la néphrologie. Avec cette réforme, un nouveau statut de « Docteur Junior » (Dr Junior) a vu le jour. Celui-ci a comme objectif majeur d’assurer la transition entre le statut d’interne et le statut de médecin senior. À travers un questionnaire réalisé par le Syndicat national des internes de néphrologie (SNIN), nous avons décidé de réaliser le bilan de ce nouveau statut dans notre spécialité. Les répondants ont été contactés via les référents de ville. Nous avons obtenu 53 questionnaires remplis par des Drs Juniors en néphrologie, d’une médiane d’âge de 29 ans, répartis sur l’ensemble du territoire français. Les choix d’affectation étaient satisfaisants dans 93 % des cas. L’activité de ces Drs Juniors était surtout orientée vers la néphrologie clinique, ou était mixte, avec la possibilité d’avoir ses propres consultations pour quasi tous les internes. Les Drs Juniors ont une activité de garde ou d’astreinte principalement centrée sur leur service d’origine, seul un tiers effectuait des remplacements. Leur volume horaire hebdomadaire était conséquent (majoritairement entre 45 et 65 h/semaine) avec un dépassement du cadre légal pour un nombre non négligeable. La supervision était globalement jugée satisfaisante. Très peu de Drs Juniors avaient du temps bien sanctuarisé pour la recherche ou la formation, néanmoins certains donnaient des cours et profitaient de formation principalement via les congrès.

PubMed,[Management of patients with kidney stones].,"Proper management of lithiasis-related diseases is essential, as they often cause pain that can be difficult to alleviate, leading to significant morbidity and substantial healthcare costs. In rare cases, lithiasis may indicate a more serious underlying condition that could progress to chronic kidney disease. The French Association of Urology (AFU) provides recommendations for the initial assessment of any patient experiencing a first episode of lithiasis, emphasizing the importance of stone analysis, dietary assessment, and crystalluria analysis when available. Simple measures, such as ensuring adequate hydration and a balanced intake of sodium, protein, and calcium, can help reduce the risk of stone formation in most cases. The use of a crystallization inhibitor, such as citrate, may also be indicated. Additional treatments may be considered depending on the stone type and any underlying biochemical abnormalities. These guidelines also describe criteria leading to a more comprehensive secondary evaluation, which may reveal conditions such as hyperoxaluria. This condition can be dietary, secondary to malabsorption, or due to genetic causes, such as primary hyperoxaluria (PH). Diagnosing PH is particularly crucial in the case of type 1 PH, as it can lead to renal failure and systemic oxalate accumulation, with a high risk of immediate recurrence in transplanted kidneys. Before the advent of RNA interference (siRNA) therapies, conservative treatment options—such as pyridoxine, hyperhydration, and crystallization inhibitors—were the primary strategies to slow the progression toward renal failure, with combined liver-kidney transplantation considered for end-stage renal disease. Current approaches now favor isolated kidney transplantation with adjunctive siRNA therapy, although this strategy requires careful, case-by-case consideration. Il est important de prendre en charge correctement une maladie lithiasique puisqu’elle entraîne une douleur parfois difficile à soulager ainsi qu’une morbidité significative et des coûts de santé substantiels. Dans certains cas rares, la maladie lithiasique est témoin d’une pathologie sous-jacente plus sévère pouvant conduire à une maladie rénale chronique. Il existe des recommandations françaises de l’Association française d’urologie (AFU) détaillant le bilan initial de tout patient ayant fait un premier épisode de maladie lithiasique mais précisant aussi l’importance de l’analyse du calcul, du bilan diététique ainsi que de la cristallurie quand elle est disponible. De simples mesures à type d’hydratation abondante, de consommation sodée, protéique et calcique équilibrée permettront dans la majorité des cas de réduire le risque lithiasique. L’ajout d’un inhibiteur de cristallisation tel que le citrate de potassium peut parfois être indiqué. D’autres thérapeutiques peuvent être discutées en fonction de l’origine du calcul et des anomalies biologiques sous-jacentes. Ces recommandations précisent également les conditions qui conduiront à la réalisation d’un bilan secondaire plus poussé. Ce bilan pourra faire découvrir l’existence, entre autres, d’une hyperoxalurie, qui pourra être diététique, secondaire à une malabsorption ou d’origine génétique (hyperoxalurie primaire [HP]). Le diagnostic d’HP a toute son importance car cette pathologie conduit (notamment dans l’HP type 1) à une défaillance rénale, ainsi qu’à l’accumulation d’oxalate systémique, avec un risque de récidive immédiat sur le greffon. Avant l’avènement des ARN interférents (siRNA), le traitement conservateur (pyridoxine, hyperhydratation, inhibiteurs de la cristallisation) était la seule option pour ralentir l’évolution vers la défaillance rénale, la double greffe foie-rein était proposée lors de la défaillance rénale.

PubMed,Enhancing individual glomerular filtration rate assessment: can we trust the equation? Development and validation of machine learning models to assess the trustworthiness of estimated GFR compared to measured GFR.,"Creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) equations are widely used in clinical practice but exhibit inherent limitations. On the other side, measuring GFR is time consuming and not available in routine clinical practice. We developed and validated machine learning models to assess the trustworthiness (i.e. the ability of equations to estimate measured GFR (mGFR) within 10%, 20% or 30%) of the European Kidney Function Consortium (EKFC) equation at the individual level. This observational study used data from European and US cohorts, comprising 22,343 participants of all ages with available mGFR results. Four machine learning and two traditional logistic regression models were trained on a cohort of 9,202 participants to predict the likelihood of the EKFC creatinine-derived eGFR falling within 30% (p30), 20% (p20) or 10% (p10) of the mGFR value. The algorithms were internally and then externally validated on cohorts of respectively 3,034 and 10,107 participants. The predictors included in the models were creatinine, age, sex, height, weight, and EKFC. The random forest model was the most robust model. In the external validation cohort, the model achieved an area under the curve of 0.675 (95%CI 0.660;0.690) and an accuracy of 0.716 (95%CI 0.707;0.725) for the P30 criterion. Sensitivity was 0.756 (95%CI 0.747;0.765) and specificity was 0.485 (95%CI 0.460; 0.511) at the 80% probability level that EKFC falls within 30% of mGFR. At the population level, the PPV of this machine learning model was 89.5%, higher than the EKFC P30 of 85.2%. A free web-application was developed to allow the physician to assess the trustworthiness of EKFC at the individual level. A strategy using machine learning model marginally improves the trustworthiness of GFR estimation at the population level. An additional value of this approach lies in its ability to provide assessments at the individual level.",BMC nephrology,2025,Lanot Antoine; Akesson Anna; Nakano Felipe Kenji; Vens Celine; Björk Jonas; Nyman Ulf; Grubb Anders; Sundin Per-Ola; Eriksen Björn O; Melsom Toralf; Rule Andrew D; Berg Ulla; Littmann Karin; Åsling-Monemi Kajsa; Hansson Magnus; Larsson Anders; Courbebaisse Marie; Dubourg Laurence; Couzi Lionel; Gaillard Francois; Garrouste Cyril; Jacquemont Lola; Kamar Nassim; Legendre Christophe; Rostaing Lionel; Ebert Natalie; Schaeffner Elke; Bökenkamp Arend; Mariat Christophe; Pottel Hans; Delanaye Pierre,Humans; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Machine Learning; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Aged; Adult; Creatinine; Cohort Studies; Algorithms; Young Adult,10.1186/s12882-025-03972-0,39885391,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39885391/
PubMed,Evaluating script concordance tests (SCTs) through the lens of Bayesian reasoning: Enhancing assessment in medical education.,"Script Concordance Tests (SCTs) represent an innovative assessment method which have been introduced in the 2024 French National Ranking Examinations (EDN). These tests compare a student's clinical reasoning with that of a panel of experts under conditions of uncertainty. Typically, the question involves the impact of new information on an initially proposed hypothesis, with answers given on a Likert scale. This article aims to didactically illustrate how SCTs are consistent with probabilistic reasoning as modeled by Bayes' theorem. In addition, by comparing SCT writing guidelines with Bayesian reasoning concepts, several ambiguities were identified: (1) What stage of clinical reasoning do SCTs evaluate? (2) What are the appropriate labels for Likert scale responses? (3) Does the expert panel provide a relevant reference for SCTs? Currently, many of these questions remain unanswered in the literature, with recent data suggesting that experienced physicians' responses to SCTs are often biased. Beyond their use as an assessment tool in the EDN, SCTs offer a valuable opportunity to develop and deepen the teaching of probabilistic reasoning in medical education and serve as a potential area of research to improve clinical practice.",Journal of epidemiology and population health,2025,Dauchet Luc; Bentegeac Raphaël; Ghauss Haress; Hazzan Marc; Truffert Patrick; Amouyel Philippe; Gauthier Victoria; Hamroun Aghiles,"Bayes Theorem; Humans; Educational Measurement; Education, Medical; Clinical Competence; Clinical Reasoning",10.1016/j.jeph.2024.202804,39848214,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39848214/
PubMed,"Current practices in prevention, screening, and treatment of diabetes in kidney transplant recipients: European survey highlights from the ERA DESCARTES Working Group.","Although post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a common complication after kidney transplantation, there are few data on prevention, optimal screening, and treatment strategies. The European Renal Association's DESCARTES working group distributed a web-based survey to European transplant centres to gather information on risk assessment, screening procedures, and management practices for preventing and treating PTDM in kidney transplant recipients. Answers were obtained from 121/241 transplant centres (50%) across 15 European countries. Screening practices for diabetes mellitus during the transplant work-up varied, with only 13% of centres using the recommended oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and 14% not screening at all. At transplantation, 19% of centres tailored the immunosuppressive regimen based on perceived PTDM risk, using strategies such as cyclosporin use or early steroid withdrawal. Fifty-two percent adopted strict glycaemic control with basal insulin in the first days post-transplant. Sixty-eight percent had defined screening protocols for early PTDM (45 days-6 months), primarily based on fasting glycaemia and/or HbA1c, while only a minority (7%) incorporated an OGTT. Changes in immunosuppression were considered by 41% in cases of early hyperglycaemia (<45 days) and by 58% in established PTDM (>45 days). Besides insulin therapy, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors and metformin were most frequently used to manage early hyperglycaemia (<45 days) and PTDM (>45 days). The use of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-analogues increased >45 days post-transplantation. This European survey underscores the significant variation in PTDM prevention, screening, and treatment practices, emphasizing the imperative for more explicit guidance in approaching this complication.",Clinical kidney journal,2025,Laghrib Yassine; Hilbrands Luuk; Oniscu Gabriel C; Crespo Marta; Gandolfini Ilaria; Mariat Christophe; Mjøen Geir; Sever Mehmet Sukru; Watschinger Bruno; Velioglu Arzu; Demir Erol; Martinez Eva Gavela; De Weerd Annelies; Dedinska Ivana; Pippias Maria; Massart Annick; Abramowicz Daniel; de Fijter Johan Willem; De Block Christophe; Hellemans Rachel,,10.1093/ckj/sfae367,39839808,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39839808/

PubMed,Standardized Outcomes for Randomized Controlled Trials Targeting Early Interventions in Patients With Moderate-to-Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Protocol for the Development of a Core Outcome Set.,": With more than 60 million new cases around the world each year, traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes substantial mortality and morbidity. Managing TBI is a major human, social, and economic concern. In the last 20 years, there has been an increase in clinical trials in neurocritical care, leading mostly to negative results. The evaluation of neurological outcomes, predominantly as primary outcomes, using clinical scales (Glasgow Outcome Scale) has limitations that could explain these results. Moreover, patient-centered outcomes are seldom reported despite their recognized clinical relevance. : The aim of this project is to establish a core outcome set (COS) for patients with moderate-to-severe TBI in randomized control trials in neurocritical care research. This study will follow five distinct steps: (1) systematic review to identify outcomes that have been reported in trials; (2) semistructured interviews with patients and their families to identify their priorities after TBI and explore potential patient-centered outcomes; (3) health care stakeholder focus groups with clinicians, researchers, and policy makers to describe potential outcomes; (4) an eDelphi survey with stakeholder groups to make a list of previously identified core outcomes; and (5) a consensus workshop to establish a COS for moderate-to-severe TBI clinical trials. : The systematic review was published in August 2024. Regarding Step 2, 30 semistructured interviews of patients and relatives were performed from July 2021 to December 2023, and analyses were completed in October 2024. Step 3 is currently under development, and Step 4 is planned for the end of 2025. Step 5 is expected to occur during fall/winter 2026. Conclusions: Establishing a COS, to be consistently measured and reported in TBI trials in neurocritical care will ensure rigorous reporting, avoid bias, and improve the integrity, transparency, and usability of clinical research. The French context of the study is the main limitation, but we are seeking international collaboration on the project. The results of each step of the project will be disseminated through abstracts, publications, and patient associations.

PubMed,Differences in association between hypoalbuminaemia and mortality among younger versus older patients on haemodialysis.,"Ageing often affects biomarker production. Yet, clinical/optimal thresholds to guide clinical decisions do not consider this. Serum albumin decreases with age, but hypoalbuminaemia is defined as serum albumin <4.0 g/dl. This study explores whether age might affect serum albumin levels and its association with mortality in haemodialysis patients. COSMOS (Current Management of Secondary Hyperparathyroidism: a Multicentre Observational Study) is a prospective, open-cohort, observational study of haemodialysis patients followed for 3 years. Binary logistic and linear regression were used to analyse the association between age and hypoalbuminaemia or serum albumin (continuous). Cox proportional hazard multivariate regression was used to examine the relationship between hypoalbuminaemia and mortality in patients younger and older than 65 years. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the discriminatory ability of serum albumin and optimal thresholds for predicting mortality. The present analysis included 5585 patients.

PubMed,Fluid overload trajectories and mortality in hemodialysis patients.,"Fluid overload remains critical in managing patients with end-stage kidney disease. However, there is limited empirical understanding of fluid overload's impact on mortality. This study analyzes fluid overload trajectories and their association with mortality in hemodialysis patients. This longitudinal study included 9332 incident hemodialysis patients from the EuCliD database, treated in Fresenius Medical Care NephroCare dialysis centers across seven countries between January 2016 and December 2019, with follow-up until May 2023. Fluid overload was assessed using bioimpedance spectroscopy, and patients were grouped based on fluid overload trajectories using group-based trajectory modeling. Cox regression models, adjusted for potential confounders, were used to investigate the relationship between trajectory groups and mortality. Four distinct fluid overload trajectories were identified. Patients in the highest trajectory group (8.5% of the cohort) had more frequent background cardiovascular complications, lower BMI and serum albumin, and their adjusted mortality risk was 2.20 times higher than the lowest trajectory. There was a dose-response relationship between trajectories and mortality. The incidence rate of death increased with the degree of fluid overload, from 8.6 deaths per 100 person-years in the lowest trajectory to 18.6 in the highest.

PubMed,Clinical Spectrum and Prognosis of Atypical Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Caused by Monoallelic Pathogenic Variants of IFT140.,"Monoallelic predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) variants in IFT140 have recently been associated with an autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)-like phenotype. This study enhanced the characterization of this phenotype. Case series. Seventy-five among 2,797 European individuals with ADPKD-like phenotypes who underwent genetic testing that revealed pLoF IFT140-variants. The 75 individuals (median age 56 years, 53.3% females) were from 61 families and were found to have 41 different monoallelic pLoF IFT140-variants. The majority of individuals presented with large, exophytic kidney cysts (median total kidney volume, 688mL [IQR, 201-4,139]), and 90.2% were classified using the Mayo Imaging Classification as Mayo Class 2A. Arterial hypertension was present in 50.7% of the individuals (median age at diagnosis, 59 years [IQR, 29-73]). Only 1 patient developed kidney failure (at age 69 years). A significant difference was observed in the age-adjusted estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between the male and female patients (P<0.001), and 56.3% of the individuals over the age of 60 years had an eGFR of<60mL/min/1.73m Retrospective study; IFT140-related cystic kidney disease may not be diagnosed in younger patients or patients with milder forms. Individuals with monoallelic IFT140 pLoF variants are likely to develop kidney cysts atypical of classic ADPKD and generally have a favorable kidney prognosis. Monoallelic pathogenic variants in IFT140 have been linked to a spectrum of kidney disease clinically similar to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). This article describes a case series of 75 individuals with ADPKD-IFT140. Affected individuals typically presented with an atypical imaging pattern, had fewer but larger kidney cysts compared with classic ADPKD, and rarely developed liver cysts. Although the kidney prognosis appeared better than in classic ADPKD, 56.3% of individuals over 60 years of age had stage 3 or more severe CKD.

PubMed,Projecting the Population Level Burden of CKD Progression According to Urine Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio Categories.,"Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) is an independent predictor of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. However there is limited evidence on the burden of CKD according to uACR categories at the population level. This study estimates future clinical and financial burden of CKD according to uACR categories using the Inside CKD microsimulation. The Inside CKD model is an individual patient level microsimulation that emulates national populations based on demographic, epidemiological, and economic data. The analysis estimates clinical and economic outcomes over time according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) uACR categories (A1-A3) at a population level for 31 countries and regions. CKD populations (diagnosed and undiagnosed individuals, stages G3-G5) were projected to be predominantly within uACR categories A1 and A2 in 2022. Projected cumulative incidence of CKD stage transitions (disease progression) and cardio-renal complications (heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality) occurred mostly in uACR categories A1 and A2 between 2022 and 2027. Patients in uACR categories A1 and A2, who represent the largest proportion of patients with CKD, were projected to incur most of the health care costs associated with CKD management and cardio-renal complications for the diagnosed population (prevalence 2027). This study highlights the disproportionate population-level clinical and economic burden associated with individuals within KDIGO uACR categories A1 and A2, who represent most of the CKD population. This awareness will help health care decision makers to appropriately allocate resources and interventions to the CKD population, including those with mild to moderately increased albuminuria, to reduce clinical and economic burden associated with CKD.",Kidney international reports,2024,De Nicola Luca; Correa-Rotter Ricardo; Navarro-González Juan F; Power Albert; Nowicki Michal; Wittmann Istvan; Halimi Jean-Michel; Garcia Sanchez Juan Jose; Cabrera Claudia; Barone Salvatore; Coker Timothy; Retat Lise,,10.1016/j.ekir.2024.09.021,39698359,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39698359/
PubMed,Anti Phospholipase A2 Receptor 1 Antibodies and Membranous Nephropathy Recurrence After Kidney Transplantation.,"Membranous nephropathy can lead to end-stage kidney disease, for which kidney transplantation is the preferred therapy. However, the disease often relapses, which can impact allograft survival. We conducted a prospective multicenter study in France involving 72 patients with membranous nephropathy who were awaiting and then underwent kidney transplantation. In addition, we established a retrospective validation cohort of 65 patients. The primary objective was to evaluate the prognostic significance of pretransplant anti phospholipase A2 receptor 1 (PLA2R1) antibodies on the recurrence of membranous nephropathy. The study also assessed the incidence rate, time to onset, and risk factors for recurrence, as well as allograft outcome. The prospective cohort showed a 26% cumulative incidence of membranous nephropathy recurrence after a median follow-up of 23.5 months. This was confirmed by a 28% cumulative incidence after a median follow-up of 67 months in the retrospective cohort.

PubMed,Challenging the narrative of alport syndrome spectrum: no link with cystic phenotype.,"Alport Syndromes (AS) are the second leading genetic cause of Kidney Failure (KF). Whether multiple kidney cysts (MKC) phenotype belongs to the AS spectrum remains debated. This multicenter retrospective study focused on patients genotyped with pathogenic COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 variants (classified as ACMG-AMP 4 or 5) between January 2011 and January 2023 across four French university hospitals. The study aimed to compare characteristics between two groups based on the presence or absence of MKC, defined by three or more cysts per kidney. The MKC group was compared to a control group with negative exome sequencing results for undetermined kidney disease (ES-UKD) to assess the association between MKC and AS. Among the 257 AS patients included, 38 (14.8%) presented MKC without variation from hereditary cystic kidney panel. MKC showed a significant association with male gender (p=0.004), cardiovascular risk factors, and loss of function variants (p=0.012). KF onset appeared significantly later, by 6 years, in MKC patients (p=0.035). Comparison with ES-UKD (n=990) control group showed no significant association between AS and MKC by univariate and multivariate analysis. Multivariate analysis identified patient age and male gender (p<0.001) as factors linked to MKC. A 14.8% prevalence of MKC was found in our cohort of 257 patients with AS. MKC-AS patients exhibited clinical and histological characteristic akin to nephroangiosclerosis. Our comprehensive analysis, incorporating a sizable ES-UKD cohort, revealed no significant association between MKC and AS, thus questioning the inclusion of MKC within the spectrum of AS.","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",2024,Pagniez Marie-Sophie; Lombardi Yannis; Fages Victor; Larrue Romain; Laboux Timothée; Gatinois Clémence; Letavernier Emmanuel; Rigothier Claire; Glowacki François; Mesnard Laurent; Robert Thomas,,10.1093/ndt/gfae290,39694697,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39694697/
PubMed,Burden of Cardio-Cerebrovascular and Renal Diseases Attributable to Systolic Hypertension in France in 2021.,"Hypertension is the most common chronic disease and a major modifiable risk factor for cardio-cerebrovascular and renal diseases. This study estimated the national burden of hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg, on morbidity and mortality in 2021 in France. For all diseases causally associated with hypertension (cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney diseases, and dementia), the number and proportion of cases attributable to hypertension in adults aged ≥35 years were estimated using population attributable fractions. Age- and sex-specific population attributable fractions were computed using the distribution of hypertension in the French population. These population attributable fractions were applied to nationwide statistics for mortality, hospitalizations, disease prevalence, years of life lost, years of life lived with disability, and disability-adjusted years of life. The largest population attributable fractions were for ischemic heart disease and hemorrhagic stroke, with over 40% of cases attributable to hypertension. Overall, more than 385 000 patients were hospitalized due to hypertension, with 3.7 million hospitalizations and 6.2 million hospital days (all hospitalizations, including 3.4 million for chronic kidney disease) and including 390 000 overnight hospitalization. In 2021, more than 1.15 million individuals lived with ischemic heart disease attributable to hypertension, 1.26 million with chronic kidney diseases, and 358 033 with heart failure. Among 184 059 annual deaths from cardiovascular diseases, dementia, and chronic kidney diseases, 30% (55 280 deaths) were attributable to hypertension. Hypertension accounted for 8.5% of all deaths and 498 052 years of life lost. In France, despite near-universal health coverage and free health care access, the burden attributable to hypertension remains high.","Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",2025,Grave Clémence; Bonaldi Christophe; Carcaillon-Bentata Laure; Gabet Amélie; Halimi Jean-Michel; Tzourio Christophe; Béjot Yannick; Torres Marion J; Steg Philippe Gabriel; Durand Zaleski Isabelle; Blacher Jacques; Olié Valérie,"Humans; France; Hypertension; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Aged; Adult; Prevalence; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Cardiovascular Diseases; Hospitalization; Kidney Diseases; Cost of Illness; Aged, 80 and over; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Risk Factors; Isolated Systolic Hypertension",10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.124.23760,39648886,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39648886/
PubMed,[Primary hyperoxaluria: results of a retrospective survey of the diagnostic practices of nephrologists].,"Primary hyperoxalurias (PH) are rare and serious genetic diseases. Their prognosis is improved with early medical management. However, diagnosis often occurs at the end-stage of renal failure. To understand this delay, collecting real-world data on the clinical practices of nephrologists may be helpful. Between October 2021 and October 2022, a retrospective survey was conducted in France among 76 nephrologists to assess management practices for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) of unknown aetiology, associated with urinary lithiasis and/or nephrocalcinosis. Data on patient profiles, tests conducted, diagnoses considered, and management of suspected PH cases were collected. 97% of patients (n = 386/400) underwent a renal examination, 92% (n = 370/400) a thorough urinary check-up, and 65% (n = 260/400) had an interpretable oxaluria value from a 24-hour urine sample (Uox24h). Of these 260 patients, 50% (n = 130/260) had Uox24h > 500 µmol/24 h: 23% (n = 30/130) were suspected of PH by the nephrologists, and 15% (n = 19/130) were referred for genotyping. Considering all criteria, 52 patients were suspected of PH (42% of whom did not have Uox24h > 500 µmol/24 h), and 33% (n = 17/52) were not referred for genotyping. The survey highlights nephrologists' adherence to recommendations for prescribing biological tests. However, in cases of hyperoxaluria or suspected PH, genotyping was not always prescribed. The barriers to this prescription need further exploration. Les hyperoxaluries primitives (HP) sont des maladies génétiques rares et graves.

Des données sur le profil des patients, les examens réalisés, les diagnostics envisagés, et la prise en charge en cas de suspicion d’HP ont été collectées. 97 % des patients (n = 386/400) bénéficiaient d’un bilan rénal, 92 % (n = 370/400) d’un bilan urinaire approfondi, et 65 % (n = 260/400) avaient une valeur d’oxalurie sur les urines de 24 heures (Uox24h) interprétable. Sur ces 260 patients, 50 % (n = 130/260) avaient une Uox24h > 500 µmol/24 h : 23 % (n = 30/130) étaient suspectés d’HP selon les néphrologues, et 15 % (n = 19/130) faisaient l’objet d’une demande de génotypage. Tous critères pris en compte, 52 patients étaient suspectés d’HP (dont 42 % sans valeur d’Uox24h > 500 µmol/24 h), et 33 % (n = 17/52) ne faisaient pas l’objet d’une demande de génotypage. L’enquête souligne le respect des recommandations par les néphrologues pour la prescription des tests biologiques.

PubMed,Behind the Healing: Exploring the Psychological Battles of Kidney Transplant Patients: A Qualitative Insight.,"Kidney transplantation is widely regarded as the optimal treatment for end-stage renal disease, offering benefits like prolonged life expectancy, enhanced quality of life, and greater cost-effectiveness compared to dialysis. While dialysis imposes considerable restrictions on patients, including diminished independence, many of these challenges can be alleviated through successful transplantation. However, despite the physical advantages of kidney transplants, the psychological struggles faced by transplant recipients are often overlooked, particularly in Ethiopia. This study aimed to delve into the psychological experiences of kidney transplant patients, shedding light on the emotional and mental battles they encounter post-transplant. This qualitative study involved kidney transplant patients at SPMMC (St. Paul's Millennium Medical College). during the study period, regardless of donor type. A total of ten participants were selected using purposive sampling. Data were collected through semi-structured, interviewer-administered questionnaires containing both closed and open-ended questions. The data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). The analysis focused on understanding participants' experiences and their interpretations of these experiences. Themes were identified by examining commonalities and differences in the participants' accounts, with special attention to areas of convergence and divergence. The analysis revealed both positive and negative psychological experiences among kidney transplant patients. Positive experiences included feelings of ""re-birth,"" thankfulness, strengthened social bonds, freedom from dialysis, enhanced self-efficacy, and increased social support. Negative experiences included dependency, fear of the future, challenges with adherence to treatment, and occasional regret. Life after a kidney transplant is significantly more positive and empowering compared to life on dialysis. However, psychological challenges remain, highlighting the need for ongoing psychological support to address both positive and negative aspects of the transplant experience. Future research should focus on providing continuous support, including counseling and support groups, and integrating these systems into kidney transplant care to enhance overall recovery.",Health science reports,2025,Wube Tsiyon Birhanu; Asgedom Solomon Gebremichael; Mengesha Abrehet Girmay; Bekele Yohannes Ayalew; Gebrekirstos Lielt Gebreselassie,,10.1002/hsr2.70511,40008222,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40008222/

PubMed,Prevention and Treatment of Peritoneal Dialysis-Associated Fibrosis with Intraperitoneal Anti-Fibrotic Therapy in Experimental Peritoneal Fibrosis.,"Long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD) often results in peritoneal damage and fibrosis, impairing peritoneal membrane function and leading to ultrafiltration failure. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic potential of nintedanib and pirfenidone in preventing and treating PD-associated peritoneal fibrosis using experimental models. An animal model of peritoneal fibrosis and cultured mesothelial cells were utilized to evaluate the effects of nintedanib and pirfenidone. Histological analysis, molecular techniques, and RNA sequencing were employed to assess the fibrosis, inflammation, and gene expression. The key outcomes included changes in the peritoneal structure, inflammatory markers, and transcriptional regulation. Induced peritoneal fibrosis resulted in significant structural and histological changes. Treatment with nintedanib and pirfenidone effectively prevented peritoneal thickening and reduced excessive fibrosis deposition. Both agents ameliorated the inflammatory responses by lowering inflammatory marker expression, inhibiting cytokine activity, and decreasing macrophage infiltration. Molecular analyses revealed the suppression of inflammation-related transcription regulators and cytokine receptors. RNA sequencing identified glucose-induced gene expression changes and demonstrated significant modulation by the treatments. In animal studies with established fibrosis, these agents reduced peritoneal inflammation and slowed fibrosis progression. This study demonstrates that intraperitoneal administration of nintedanib and pirfenidone shows promise as an anti-fibrosis therapy for preventing and treating peritoneal fibrosis associated with PD. These findings highlight the potential of targeted interventions to improve the long-term outcomes for PD patients.","Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Sun Chiao-Yin; Hsieh Yu-Ting; Lu Shang-Chieh; Huang Chi-Ying F,,10.3390/ph18020188,40006006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40006006/

PubMed,Non-Invasive Biomarkers for Early Diagnosis of Kidney Allograft Dysfunction: Current and Future Applications in the Era of Precision Medicine.,"Kidney transplantation stands as the preferred treatment for end-stage kidney disease, significantly improving both the quality and longevity of life compared to dialysis. In recent years, the survival rates for patients and grafts have markedly increased thanks to innovative strategies in desensitization protocols for incompatible transplants and advancements in immunosuppressive therapies. For kidney transplant recipients, preventing allograft rejection is of paramount importance, necessitating the use of immunosuppressive medications. Regular follow-up appointments are essential, as monitoring the function of the kidney allograft is critical. Currently, established biomarkers such as serum creatinine, estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), proteinuria, and albuminuria are commonly employed to assess allograft function. However, these biomarkers have limitations, as elevated levels often indicate significant allograft damage only after it has occurred, thereby constraining treatment options and the potential for restoring graft function. Additionally, kidney biopsies, while considered the gold standard for diagnosing rejection, are invasive and carry associated risks. Consequently, the identification and development of new, sensitive, and specific biomarkers like dd-cfDNA, microRNAs (e.g., miR-21, miR-155), and sCD30 for allograft rejection are crucial. To tackle this challenge, intensive ongoing research employing cutting-edge technologies, including ""omics"" approaches, like genomic techniques, proteomics, or metabolomics, is uncovering a variety of promising new biomarkers.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2025,Lazarou Christina; Moysidou Eleni; Christodoulou Michalis; Lioulios Georgios; Sampani Erasmia; Dimitriadis Chrysostomos; Fylaktou Asimina; Stangou Maria,Humans; Biomarkers; Kidney Transplantation; Precision Medicine; Graft Rejection; Early Diagnosis; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Allografts,10.3390/medicina61020262,40005378,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40005378/

The goal of this project was to evaluate the impact of administering an oral nutritional supplement combined with a probiotic blend on the microbiota, intestinal permeability, and depression symptoms in malnourished hemodialysis patients. With this aim, a randomized trial was conducted with three parallel groups: a control group with individualized diet, a supplement-placebo (SU-PL) group with oral nutritional supplementation (ONS), and a supplement-probiotic (SU-PR) group with ONS in conjunction with a probiotic blend. Blood and fecal samples were collected at basal time, and at 3 and 6 months. Several blood biomarkers, like zonulin, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), were measured, and the fecal microbiome was sequenced with the Illumina platform. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used for the estimation of depression (HADS-D) and anxiety (HADS-A) symptoms, along with the standardized mental health index SF12-MH from the general health questionnaire SF-12. The results showed that patients who consumed the probiotic blend maintained the LPS levels from their baseline readings and decreased their BDNF levels compared to the SU-PL or control groups. Moreover, a significant decrease in HADS-D scores (less depressive symptoms) and an increase in SF12-MH scores (higher quality of life) were found in that group in comparison to the other groups.

PubMed,Current Progress in Peritoneal Dialysis: A Narrative Review of Progress in Peritoneal Dialysis Fluid.,"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a renal replacement therapy that removes solutes, electrolytes, and water via the infusion of dialysis fluid into the peritoneal cavity. However, the non-physiological composition of conventional PD fluids can cause peritoneal injury, leading to complications such as peritoneal fibrosis and encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis. This review highlights recent advancements in PD fluid formulations aimed at improving biocompatibility and reducing peritoneal damage. While glucose-based solutions remain the standard because of their affordability, their glucose degradation products (GDPs) and advanced glycation end-products significantly contribute to peritoneal fibrosis. Innovations, such as neutral pH and low-GDP solutions, have been developed to counter these effects, enhancing peritoneal integrity and preserving residual renal function. Alternative osmotic agents, such as icodextrin, offer superior ultrafiltration. Advancements in buffer formulations, including bicarbonate-based and bicarbonate/lactate combinations, have further enhanced the biocompatibility of PD fluids. Despite these progressions, challenges persist.

PubMed,Acute Kidney Injury in Patients After Cardiac Arrest: Effects of Targeted Temperature Management.,"Cardiac arrest (CA) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, with survivors often developing post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS), characterized by systemic inflammation, ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), and multiorgan dysfunction. Acute kidney injury (AKI), a frequent complication, is associated with increased mortality and prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stays. This study evaluates AKI incidence and progression in cardiac arrest patients managed with different temperature protocols and explores urinary biomarkers' predictive value for AKI risk. A prospective, single-center observational study was conducted, including patients with Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) post-cardiac arrest. Patients were stratified into three groups: therapeutic hypothermia (TH) at 33 °C, Targeted Temperature Management (TTM) at 35 °C, and no temperature management (No TTM). AKI was defined using KDIGO criteria, with serum creatinine and urinary biomarkers (TIMP-2 and IGFBP7) measured at regular intervals during ICU stay. AKI incidence at 72 h was 31%, varying across protocols. It was higher in the No TTM group at 24 h and in the TH and TTM groups during rewarming. Persistent serum creatinine elevation and fluid imbalance were notable in the TH group. Biomarkers indicated moderate tubular stress in the TTM and No TTM groups. AKI is a frequent complication post-cardiac arrest, with the rewarming phase identified as critical for renal vulnerability. Tailored renal monitoring, biomarker-guided risk assessment, and precise temperature protocols are essential to improve outcomes.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,De Rosa Silvia; Lassola Sergio; Visconti Federico; De Cal Massimo; Cattin Lucia; Rizzello Veronica; Lampariello Antonella; Zannato Marina; Danzi Vinicio; Marcante Stefano,,10.3390/life15020265,40003674,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40003674/
PubMed,Advances in Multitarget Therapeutic Approaches for Immune-Mediated Glomerular Diseases.,"Glomerulonephritis (GN) encompasses a diverse group of immune-mediated diseases that damage the glomerular component of the nephron. While kidney biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis, it often fails to provide adequate insight into the underlying etiology of GN. Current classification systems have limited our understanding of the disease's pathophysiology and hinder the development of targeted therapies. Immunosuppressive treatments, such as glucocorticoids, calcineurin inhibitors, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab, remain the mainstay of therapy, though many patients fail to achieve remission or experience significant adverse effects. Moreover, the complex and multifactorial nature of GN pathogenesis calls for more refined therapeutic approaches. In recent years, multitarget therapies-combining different immunosuppressive agents targeting distinct immune pathways-have emerged as promising alternatives. Evidence suggests that multitarget therapy may offer superior outcomes compared to standard treatments. Despite early success, further studies are needed to optimize these regimens, reduce toxicity, and extend benefits to a broader range of GN patients. The development of personalized, biomarker-driven treatments, potentially leveraging innovative drug delivery systems and targeted biologics, holds promise for transforming GN care in the future.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Voroneanu Luminita; Covic Andreea; Tesar Vladimir; Kanbay Mehmet; Covic Adrian,,10.3390/life15020243,40003652,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40003652/

This study investigates the impact of an 8-month structured group exercise program on cardiovascular health indicators among 320 women aged 60 and older living independently in Rijeka. Participants engaged in biweekly sessions designed to improve mobility, balance, and strength. Key metrics, including blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip (WHR) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), and hand grip strength, were measured before and after the intervention. Results revealed significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (mean -3.4 mmHg) and pulse pressure among hypertensive participants, highlighting improved cardiovascular function. BP control significantly improved (7.2%), and 19% of untreated hypertensive subjects at the start become normotensive at the end of follow-up. Although BMI changes were minimal, WHtR improvements indicated reductions in central obesity and muscle fat redistribution. Hand grip strength increased significantly on both arms, correlating with physical capacity.

Among the viral pathogens encountered in this population, herpes simplex virus (HSV), a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, has an important place. HSV type 2 infections in this immunosuppressed population are primarily due to viral reactivation. While HSV-2 frequently presents as genital herpes or remains asymptomatic, in rare cases, it can lead to severe neurological manifestations, such as encephalitis, particularly in the early post-transplant period with a reported mortality rate of up to 40%. We present the case of a 49-year-old male who, three years after kidney transplantation, developed acute neurological symptoms, including aphasia and disorientation. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) identified HSV-2 as the causative pathogen, enabling a swift and accurate diagnosis. The patient was promptly treated with intravenous acyclovir, adjusted for renal function, resulting in complete neurological recovery and subsequent negative follow-up CSF PCR results. This case emphasizes the vital role of PCR diagnostics as the gold standard for confirming viral encephalitis, particularly in immunosuppressed patients, where atypical presentations can complicate diagnosis. It also highlights the importance of considering HSV-2 encephalitis in the differential diagnosis even beyond the immediate post-transplant period.

Iptacopan (LNP023) is an oral, proximal complement inhibitor specifically targeting factor B, that selectively inhibits the alternative complement pathway. This was a phase 2 extension study of 26 adult patients with native kidney (cohort A), or recurrent C3G (post kidney transplantation; cohort B) receiving open label iptacopan.

PubMed,[Anti-inflammatory therapeutic advances in nephrology: can we learn from cardiology?].,"Pathophysiology of kidney diseases frequently implies sterile inflammation, e.g. during glomerulonephritis or after renal transplantation. Recently, the relevance of systemic low-grade inflammation for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and complications of CKD have come into focus. In this review article, the etiology, and consequences of low-grade inflammation in CKD patients are discussed. Further, the potential of anti-inflammatory approaches to slow down CKD progression is addressed. Recent advances have resulted in FDA approval of colchicine for patients with preserved renal function and atherosclerosis. Thus, lastly, anti-inflammatory therapy of atherosclerosis in patients with or without CKD is outlined.Taken together, anti-inflammatory therapy offers novel opportunities to improve CKD progression, inhibit transition from acute to chronic kidney disease and reduce the risk of fatal long-term complications such as cardiovascular disease. Während Nierenerkrankungen, die mit akuter nicht infektiöser Entzündung einhergehen, wie bspw. Glomerulonephritiden, bereits seit Jahrzehnten erfolgreich primär antiinflammatorisch behandelt werden, ist die Low-Grade-Inflammation in der Nephrologie bisher noch wenig beachtet.Nun rückt jedoch die pathophysiologische Bedeutung der chronischen systemischen Low-Grade-Inflammation für die Progression der chronischen Nierenerkrankung (CKD) und die damit verbundenen kardiovaskulären Komplikationen in den Vordergrund.Antiinflammatorische Strategien haben in klinischen Studien bereits eine Effektivität in der Sekundär- und Tertiärprävention kardiovaskulärer Ereignisse gezeigt.

PubMed,Metabolomics to Identify Unclassified Uremic Toxins: A Comprehensive Literature Review.,"A comprehensive review of known uremic retention molecules goes back to more than 10 years ago and did not consider metabolomic analyses. The present analysis searches for as of yet unclassified solutes retained in chronic kidney disease (CKD) by analyzing metabolites associated with relevant outcomes of CKD. This untargeted metabolomics-based approach is compared with a conventional targeted literature search. For the selected molecules, the literature was screened for arguments regarding toxic (harmful), beneficial, or neutral effects in experimental or clinical studies. Findings were independently crosschecked. In total, 103 molecules were selected. No literature on any effect was found for 55 substances, 3 molecules had no significant effect, and 13 others showed beneficial effects. For the remaining 32 compounds, we found at least one report of a toxic effect. Whereas 62.5% of the compounds with at least one study on a toxic effect was retrieved via the bottom-up approach, 69.2% of the substances originating from metabolomics-based approaches showed a beneficial effect. Our results suggest that untargeted metabolomics offer a more balanced view of uremic retention than the targeted approaches, with higher chances of revealing the beneficial potential of some of the metabolites.",Kidney medicine,2025,Vanholder Raymond; Glorieux Griet; Argiles Angel; Burtey Stéphane; Cohen Gerald; Duranton Flore; Koppe Laetitia; Massy Ziad A; Ortiz Alberto; Masereeuw Rosalinde; Stamatialis Dimitrios; Jankowski Joachim,,10.1016/j.xkme.2024.100955,39980938,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39980938/
PubMed,Unveiling the role of sex in the metabolism of indoxyl sulfate and apixaban.,"Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is associated with heightened risk of thrombosis. Prescription of anticoagulants is key to manage it; however, CKD patients have shown an increased risk of bleeding under anticoagulation therapy compared to non-CKD patients. We hypothesized that the sex could modify the metabolism of indoxyl sulfate (IS), a uremic toxin and Apixaban. Our intoxication model shows that higher doses of IS and apixaban accumulate in the plasma of female mice because of expression differences in efflux transporters and cytochromes in the liver, ileum and kidneys, when compared to males. Furthermore, we found that accumulation of apixaban in females contributes to increased bleeding. Transcriptional analysis of liver samples revealed elevated Sult1a1 but reduced Abcg2 and Cyp3a11 in female mice, while in the kidneys the expression rates of Oat1 and Oat3 were respectively lower and higher than those observed in males, potentially affecting drug clearance. Whole proteomics liver analysis confirmed the previous transcriptional results at the protein level and revealed that sex had a major influence in regulating both coagulation and drug metabolism pathways. Thus, our findings underline the need for inclusive clinical and preclinical trials to accurately reflect sex-specific metabolic variations, and to consider CKD-specific changes to optimize dosing, minimize side effects, and improve patient outcomes.",Scientific reports,2025,Pina-Beltran Blanca; Dimitrov Daniel; McKay Nathalie; Giot Matthieu; Zdráhal Zbyněk; Potěšil David; Pustka Václav; Peinado-Izaguerri Jorge; Saez-Rodriguez Julio; Poitevin Stéphane; Burtey Stéphane,"Animals; Female; Male; Pyrazoles; Indican; Mice; Pyridones; Liver; Kidney; Sex Factors; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2; Anticoagulants; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Organic Anion Transport Protein 1; Organic Anion Transporters, Sodium-Independent; Hemorrhage; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A; Mice, Inbred C57BL",10.1038/s41598-025-90405-5,39972038,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39972038/

The completeness of 24-h urinary collection is assessed by urinary creatinine excretion, which reflects the muscle mass. Hence, it is of paramount importance to define expected values of daily urinary creatinine excretion to correctly interpret urinary collection. These references are available for the general population. We hypothesized that these reference values might not be applicable to individuals with obesity whose body composition is different from general population. Our objective was to define daily urinary creatinine excretion among population with obesity. We conducted a monocentric, retrospective, observational study, including adult patients (≥18 y) admitted for measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

PubMed,"Depression in chronic kidney disease: Particularities, specific mechanisms and therapeutic considerations, a narrative review.","Depression is highly prevalent during chronic kidney disease (CKD) with studies suggesting prevalence rates ranging from approximately one-quarter to half of CKD patients. CKD and depression have a bidirectional relationship, each disorder aggravating the other, leading to more complex and challenging patient management. Depression during CKD is multifactorial and is associated with increased risk of adverse events and hospitalization. We conducted a narrative review of experimental and observational studies in animals and humans, as well as meta-analyses, to explore specific mechanisms of depression in CKD and its treatment. In depression the gut-brain axis is central. CKD leads to an accumulation of gut-derived uremic toxins. One key factor is the accumulation of tryptophan-derived uremic toxins like kynurenines or indoxyl sulfate, whose serum concentration increases progressively with the stage of CKD (up to 100-fold in stage 5), and which plays an important role in depression mechanisms, by activating aryl hydrocarbon receptor, decreasing brain concentrations of serotonin by approximately 40 %, increasing brain inflammation, via activation of microglia and astrocytes and release of TNFα, IL-6 and NO. Randomized controlled studies found limited or no benefits of antidepressants for depressive symptoms in CKD and hemodialysis patients. Chronic inflammation, in relation to uremic toxin accumulation during CKD, seems to be a complex but important mechanism for treatment resistance in depression. Future research should consider inhibitors of uremic toxins inhibitors and anti-inflammatory molecules as potential therapeutic agents, to improve the prognosis of depression in CKD patients.",Behavioural brain research,2025,Lefrère Antoine; Burtey Stéphane; Bobot Stanislas; Belzeaux Raoul; Bobot Mickaël,"Humans; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Animals; Depression; Brain-Gut Axis; Uremic Toxins; Antidepressive Agents",10.1016/j.bbr.2025.115467,39923943,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39923943/

We compared the risks of the different reasons for transfer to HD in PD patients according to the use of assistance for PD care, PD modality, and the suboptimal starter status. This was a retrospective study using data from the French Language Peritoneal Dialysis Registry from patients who started PD between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2018. We used Cox and Fine Gray survival models to evaluate the risks of transfer to HD due to PD inadequacy, infection, mechanical issue, psychosocial issue, others PD-related and others non-PD-related causes. Models were evaluated for three periods of PD vintage: 0 to 6 months, 6 to 18 months, and after 18 months. The study included 15,974 incident PD patients treated in 170 French PD units. There were 6,835 deaths, 5,108 transfers to HD and 3,092 renal transplantations. Nurse-assisted PD was associated with a lower risk of transfer to HD for infection in the first 18 months (cs-HR 0.51, 95%CI 0.31-0.83 before 6 months) and for adequacy issues after 6 months (cs-HR 0.59, 95%CI 0.51-0.70 after 18 months). The risk of transfer for mechanical issue was higher in CAPD compared to APD during the first eighteen months (cs-HR 1.41, 95%CI 1.00-1.99 before 6 months), but CAPD was associated with a lower risk for adequacy, infectious or mechanical issue after 18 months. Finally, suboptimal starters have a higher risk of transfer due to psychosocial challenges in the first 6 months (cs-HR 1.70, 95%CI 1.03-2.81).

Having a kidney disease negatively affects a woman's reproductive health, making infertility a significant concern, and women with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasingly seeking treatment with assisted reproductive technology. The side effects of assisted reproductive technology are not fully known and its impact on kidney function, especially if a woman has undergone repeated treatments, is likewise not known. This case series gathers all consecutive patients who were followed by the Mansoura University Hospital's Obstetric Nephrology Service or were admitted to its Nephrology and Gynecology Department during pregnancy with a diagnosis of acute or chronic kidney function impairment after conceiving with an assisted reproductive technology method, in the period from 2021 to 2024. Of the approximately 150 pregnancies referred to the Obstetric Nephrology Clinic, 6 were referred for acute or acute-on-chronic kidney function impairment, or nephrotic syndrome after conceiving via assisted reproductive technology. In one patient, CKD was overlooked and later progressed to kidney failure; one had probable CKD, but discontinued follow-up before confirmation; and one had a kidney malformation, diagnosed during pregnancy. All presented with early or very early severe hypertension and proteinuria, before 20 weeks, while preeclampsia and the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are conventionally defined as developing after 20 weeks of gestation. Three had complete recovery postpartum, one progressed to kidney failure, while two were lost to follow-up.

Prevalence in paediatrics varies according to studies. The data being rare in the ivorian context, this study aims to describe these defects' epidemiological, clinical, therapeutic and evolutionary aspects in children in a reference hospital setting. We performed a retrospective and descriptive study held in the Yopougon's Teaching Hospital Pediatric Nephrology Unit from December 1st 2008 to December 31st 2020. It involved 152 children aged 0 to 15 years, admitted to the unit, with a congenital anomaly of the kidney and the urinary tract diagnosed with radiology. Socio-demographic characteristics: congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract's prevalence was 11%. The median age at admission was 36 months. The median age at diagnosis of malformative uropathy was 17.5 months. The sex ratio (M/F) was 2.3. Clinical characteristics: posterior urethra valves were the most common malformative uropathy (38%). Malformative uropathy was associated with other defects in 4% of cases. The antenatal diagnosis involved 24% of patients. The average gestational age of discovery was 32 weeks of amenorrhea. In the postnatal period, abdominal pain was the main circumstance for discovery (39%). Therapeutic characteristics: surgery was indicated in 58% of patients and performed in 64% of cases. Evolutionary characteristics: evolution was better in patients who had received surgical treatment (asymptomatic in 83% of cases, occurrence of urinary tract infection in 35% of cases and chronic renal failure in 23% of cases). 72% of the study population was lost. In Côte d'Ivoire, malformatives uropathies are late-discovered and are dominated by posterior urethra valves. Knowledge and management of these renal and urinary tract defects deserve to be improved through the development of antenatal diagnosis and training of practitioners in early recognition of clinical signs. The high rate of lost patients must be reduced by the implementation of an active patients' follow-up system.

In particular, the working group recommends abandoning terms that used to correspond in French to “chronic renal failure”, “acute renal failure”, “end-stage renal failure”, “uremia”, “cadaveric donor” and “microalbuminuria”, in favor of French equivalents of “chronic renal disease”, “acute kidney injury”, “renal failure”, “uremic syndrome”, “deceased donor” and “albuminuria”. Arguments against the former and in favor of the latter are presented. Other equivalents of English terms from the KDIGO nomenclature are presented in a Table, and an Appendix presents equivalents proposed in German and Spanish by other authors.

PubMed,[ANCA-associated vasculitides: what nephrologists need to know].,"Renal involvement in ANCA vasculitides (AAV) is frequent and often severe, leading to end-stage kidney disease either immediately, in the follow-up or after episodes of relapses. Renal involvement is associated with other organ involvement in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (PAM), but may also be isolated in vasculitis limited to the kidney. It is less common in eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GEPA). The classical clinical presentation is one of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, associated with the presence of PR3-ANCA or MPO-ANCA. Kidney biopsy (showing pauci-immune extra-capillary glomerulonephritis) is not essential for the diagnosis of VAA, but it does have a prognostic value, can rule out other causes of glomerulonephritis (especially in renal-limited forms of AAV) and can help for the decision of plasma exchange use. Treatment of AAV with renal involvement is based on a combination of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants (rituximab or cyclophosphamide). Avacopan may also be proposed as a cortisone-sparing treatment. This review sets out the various recommended therapeutic protocols and their scope of application. The role of plasma exchange is also discussed. L’atteinte rénale des vascularites à ANCA (VAA) est fréquente, souvent sévère, pouvant conduire à l’insuffisance rénale chronique terminale d’emblée, lors du suivi ou à l’occasion d’une rechute.

Elle est plus rare au cours de la granulomatose éosinophilique avec polyangéite (GEPA). Le tableau biologique classique est celui d’une glomérulonéphrite rapidement progressive, associée à la présence d’ANCA de spécificité anti-PR3 ou anti-MPO. La biopsie rénale (montrant une glomérulonéphrite extra-capillaire pauci-immune) n’est pas indispensable au diagnostic de VAA mais elle a une valeur pronostique, élimine les diagnostics alternatifs (en particulier dans les formes rénales isolées) et peut aider à la décision de réaliser des échanges plasmatiques. Le traitement des VAA avec atteinte rénale repose sur l’association de corticoïdes et d’immunosuppresseurs (rituximab ou cyclophosphamide).

The main causes of sleep disorders are pruritus, depression, restless legs syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea. To date, there is no defined strategy or expert consensus for the screening of sleep disorders in this population, nor any recommendation on a specific management strategy according to etiology. We propose to use the PROMIS-29 questionnaire, to which two questions have been added: “Do you scratch yourself? Do you snore?” The answers to these questions, together with the scores for the “Sleep disorders” (score ≥ 12), “Depression” (score ≥ 11), “Pain” (score ≥ 11) and “Fatigue” (score ≥ 14) domains make it possible to screen for sleep disorders, specify their etiology and refer patients for appropriate management. We suggest a standardized management strategy for each major orientation. This pathway, to be adapted according to the resources of each center, should lead to the diagnosis of more patients suffering from sleep disorders and improve their quality of life. Les troubles du sommeil sont fréquents à tous les stades de la maladie rénale chronique et affectent considérablement la qualité de vie des patients. Les principales causes de ces troubles sont le prurit, la dépression, le syndrome des jambes sans repos et le syndrome d’apnée hypopnée obstructive du sommeil. À ce jour, il n’existe ni stratégie définie, ni consensus d’experts pour le dépistage des troubles du sommeil dans cette population, ni de recommandations spécifiques pour leur prise en charge en fonction de l’étiologie.

La réponse à ces questions ainsi que les scores pour les domaines « Troubles du sommeil » (score ≥ 12), « Dépression » (score ≥ 11), « Douleur » (score ≥ 11) et « Fatigue » (score ≥ 14) permettent de dépister les troubles du sommeil, de préciser leur étiologie et d’orienter les patients vers une prise en charge adaptée. Nous suggérons une stratégie standardisée pour la prise en charge selon chaque grande orientation. Ce chemin, à adapter selon les ressources de chaque centre, devrait permettre de diagnostiquer plus de patients souffrant de troubles du sommeil et d’améliorer leur qualité de vie.",Nephrologie & therapeutique,2024,Franko Benoit; Houillon Lydie; Kosmadakis Georgios; Testa Angelo; Belarbi Karim; Desré-Follet Valérie; Launois-Rollinat Sandrine,,10.1684/ndt.2024.96,39917791,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39917791/

PubMed,Irisin-mediated muscle-renal crosstalk as a protective mechanism against contrast-induced acute kidney injury via cGAS-STING signalling inhibition.,"Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) continues to pose a pressing clinical challenge during invasive cardiovascular procedures due to the limited availability of preventative strategies. We aimed to demonstrate that irisin, a myokine induced by exercise, protects against CI-AKI by inhibiting the cGAS-STING inflammatory pathway. We explored the relationship between serum irisin levels and CI-AKI incidence in patients administered the contrast media iohexol. Notably, lower serum irisin levels were strongly associated with an increased incidence of CI-AKI following contrast media administration. To establish a causal link between serum irisin levels and CI-AKI, we utilised a mouse model that simulates exercise by overexpressing muscle-specific PGC-1α. This approach showed a significant reduction in tubular injury and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by iohexol via cGAS/STING suppression, thereby diminishing inflammation. Mechanistically, irisin was found to inhibit the activation of cGAS/STING, preventing double stranded DNA (dsDNA) leakage and reducing inflammation in tubular epithelial cells (TECs). Pharmacological inhibition of STING further corroborated these observations. Moreover, we identified integrin complex αV/β5 as the irisin receptor on TECs, which is essential for irisin-mediated suppression of cGAS-STING signalling and resolution of inflammation. Our data position irisin as a crucial factor in muscle‒kidney crosstalk, inhibiting cGAS-STING signalling and preventing dsDNA leakage via integrin αV/β5 in TECs, thus mitigating tubular injury and inflammation. These data underscore the potential of irisin as both a predictive biomarker for CI-AKI and a promising candidate for preventative strategies against CI-AKI. Irisin mediated muscle-kidney crosstalk mitigated tubular injury and inflammation. Irisin inhibited the cGAS-STING signalling activation via integrin αV/β5 in tubular epithelial cells.

PubMed,Kidney hemodynamic effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in diabetes: physiology and clinical implications.,"The progressive loss of kidney function in diabetes mellitus is partly attributable to the occurrence of glomerular hyperfiltration. Consequently, therapeutic interventions that lower intra-glomerular pressure are a cornerstone of treatment in diabetic kidney disease. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors consistently reduce glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and calculated intraglomerular pressures across studies. However, the net effect on arteriolar tone that leads to acute GFR declines may differ between cohorts. While pre-glomerular vasoconstriction appears to be the dominant mechanism responsible for GFR dipping in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and glomerular hyperfiltration, other factors, including post-glomerular vasodilation, may contribute to the acute GFR decline in normofilterering individuals with T1D and type 2 diabetes. Regardless of the responsible mechanisms, acute changes in GFR are associated with long-term kidney function preservation-a relationship that may reflect an underlying protective decline in glomerular hypertension.",Clinical kidney journal,2025,León-Jiménez David; Sridhar Vikas S; López-Mendoza Manuel; Scholtes Rosalie A; Schmieder Roland E; Cherney David Z I; van Raalte Daniël H; Toro-Prieto Francisco J; Miramontes-González José Pablo; van Bommel Erik J M,,10.1093/ckj/sfae370,40008354,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40008354/
PubMed,Renal function and clinical outcomes in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.,"Comprehensive studies about renal-function changes in the context of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) have been lacking. Therefore, we investigated the impact of renal function on clinical outcomes among patients with OHCA. This retrospective cohort study enrolled consecutive patients with OHCA between June 2017 and December 2021. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined based on the ""Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)"" guidelines. AKI recovery was defined as a decrease in serum creatinine below the level determined in the definition of AKI. Clinical outcomes included neurological outcomes and all-cause mortality. A total of 258 patients were enrolled, including 35 patients with underlying end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Among patients without ESRD, 82.5% developed AKI, of which 31.0% achieved AKI recovery, while 61.0% were discharged with impaired renal function. Multivariable analysis using regression models revealed that unfavorable neurological outcomes at discharge and higher mortality at 2 years were associated with AKI (odds ratio [OR] 7.684, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.683-22.010,  AKI, AKI without recovery, and impaired pre-discharge renal function were significantly correlated with worse clinical outcomes in OHCA among patients without ESRD, while underlying ESRD did not lead to worse clinical outcomes.",Resuscitation plus,2025,Lee Hao-Wei; Kuo Ming-Jen; Hsu Pai-Feng; Lee I-Hsin; Yang Chih-Yu; Hsu Teh-Fu; How Chorng-Kuang; Lin Yenn-Jiang; Huang Chin-Chou,,10.1016/j.resplu.2025.100881,40008318,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40008318/
PubMed,Association between geriatric nutritional risk index and overactive bladder in the elderly population: a cross-sectional study.,"The prevalence of overactive bladder (OAB) is increasing in the elderly population and there is growing evidence that malnutrition affects the urinary system. Despite this, research on the relationship between nutritional factors and OAB remains limited. We included 17,161 elderly individuals from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted between 2005 and 2018. Overactive Bladder Symptom Scores (OABSS) were utilized to assess symptoms of OAB. A multifactorial logistic regression analysis was employed to evaluate the independent association between the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) and the prevalence of OAB. Restricted cubic spline plots examined the potential non-linear relationship between GNRI and OAB. Influencing factors were assessed through subgroup analyses, while the predictive utility of GNRI was assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The influence of inflammatory response and cognitive function on the interaction between GNRI and OAB was also examined by mediation analysis. GNRI in the OAB group was significantly lower than that in the non-OAB group. Multifactorial logistic regression analysis revealed that GNRI significantly predicts OAB ( GNRI serves as a reliable predictive marker for OAB in the elderly population, demonstrating a nonlinear inverse correlation with OAB prevalence. Furthermore, this study elucidates the underlying inflammatory mechanisms that link GNRI to the development of OAB.",Frontiers in nutrition,2025,Zheng Wei; Zhou Chuanzan; Miao Jia; Yang Yunkai; Hu Xuanhan; Wang Heng; Zhang Xinyu; Zhang Qi; Wang Yifan,,10.3389/fnut.2025.1537549,40008309,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40008309/
PubMed,Association between non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio and macroalbuminuria: evidence from NHANES 1999-2018.,"The non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (NHHR) is a crucial lipid marker associated with various cardiovascular diseases. However, its relationship with kidney injury, particularly albuminuria, remains poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the association between NHHR and macroalbuminuria in U.S. adults. This cross-sectional study utilized data from the 1999-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). NHHR was calculated as (Total cholesterol - HDL cholesterol)/HDL cholesterol. Macroalbuminuria was defined by an albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) >300 mg/g. Logistic regression, smoothed curve fitting, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analysis were employed to assess the relationship between NHHR and macroalbuminuria. A total of 41,225 participants were included in the analysis. Higher NHHR was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of macroalbuminuria (OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.13-1.59, p=0.0007). Subgroup analysis revealed a stronger association in participants with BMI ≥30 kg/m In U.S. adults, an increased likelihood of incident NHHR levels of macroalbuminuria is positively associated and is more pronounced in those with a BMI ≥30kg/m",Frontiers in endocrinology,2025,Huang Dongli; He Yuan,"Humans; Male; Female; Albuminuria; Cross-Sectional Studies; Nutrition Surveys; Middle Aged; Cholesterol, HDL; Adult; Biomarkers; Aged; Cholesterol; United States",10.3389/fendo.2025.1503780,40007809,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40007809/

Although the global prevalence has been decreasing, the immigration of certain populations with suboptimal vaccination coverage has contributed to its resurgence in developed countries. We report a 16-year-old Afghan male with acute respiratory distress and life-threatening complications, including fulminant myocarditis with cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic complications. This case highlights the significance of optimal vaccination coverage, especially the vaccination status of migrants.

PubMed,Advancing risk stratification in kidney transplantation: integrating HLA-derived T-cell epitope and B-cell epitope matching algorithms for enhanced predictive accuracy of HLA compatibility.,"The immune-mediated rejection of transplanted organs is a complex interplay between T cells and B cells, where the recognition of HLA-derived epitopes plays a crucial role. Several algorithms of molecular compatibility have been suggested, each focusing on a specific aspect of epitope immunogenicity. Considering reported death-censored graft survival in the SRTR dataset, we evaluated four models of molecular compatibility: antibody-verified Eplets, Snow, PIRCHE-II and amino acid matching. We have statistically evaluated their co-dependency and synergistic effects between models systematically on 400,935 kidney transplantations using Cox proportional hazards and XGBoost models. Multivariable models of histocompatibility generally outperformed univariable predictors, with a combined model of HLA-A, -B, -DR matching, Snow and PIRCHE-II yielding highest AUC in XGBoost and lowest BIC in Cox models. Augmentation of a clinical prediction model of pre-transplant parameters by molecular compatibility metrics improved model performance particularly considering long-term outcomes. Our study demonstrates that the use of multiple specialized molecular HLA matching predictors improves prediction performance, thereby improving risk classification and supporting informed decision-making in kidney transplantation.",Frontiers in immunology,2025,Niemann Matthias; Matern Benedict M; Gupta Gaurav; Tanriover Bekir; Halleck Fabian; Budde Klemens; Spierings Eric,"Kidney Transplantation; Humans; HLA Antigens; Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte; Algorithms; Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte; Graft Rejection; Histocompatibility Testing; Graft Survival; Risk Assessment; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Histocompatibility",10.3389/fimmu.2025.1548934,40007544,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40007544/
PubMed,Endothelial damage and complement dysregulation in fetuses from pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia.,"Our objective was to evaluate the endothelial function profile and complement system in fetuses from preeclamptic pregnancies using ex vivo and in vitro approaches. A total of 66 singleton pregnancies were prospectively recruited comprising 34 cases of preeclampsia and 32 normotensive pregnancies matched for baseline characteristics. In the ex vivo approach, soluble tumor necrosis factor-a receptor 1 (sTNFR1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), Von Willebrand factor (sVWF), terminal complement complex (sC5b-9), Factor H, complement component C3a and Factor Bb were analyzed in fetal cord blood samples. In the in vitro model, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), Von Willebrand factor (VWF), vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-Cadherin), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and C5b-9 deposits were evaluated on endothelial cells in culture exposed to fetal sera or plasma.

Climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution negatively impact all life on earth. All populations are impacted but not equally; the most vulnerable are at highest risk, an inequity further exacerbated by differences in access to healthcare globally.The delivery of healthcare exacerbates the planetary health crisis through greenhouse gas emissions, largely due to combustion of fossil fuels for medical equipment production and operation, creation of medical and non-medical waste, and contamination of water supplies.As representatives of radiology societies from across the globe who work closely with industry, and both governmental and non-governmental leaders in multiple capacities, we advocate together for urgent, impactful, and measurable changes to the way we deliver care by further engaging our members, policymakers, industry partners, and our patients. Simultaneous challenges including global health disparities, resource allocation, and access to care must inform these efforts.Climate literacy should be increasingly added to radiology training programmes. More research is required to understand and measure the environmental impact of radiological services and inform mitigation, adaptation and monitoring efforts. Deeper collaboration with industry partners is necessary to support innovations in the supply chain, energy utilization, and circular economy. Many solutions have been proposed and are already available, but we must understand and address barriers to implementation of current and future sustainable innovations. Finally, there is a compelling need to partner with patients, to ensure that trust in the excellence of clinical care is maintained during the transition to sustainable radiology.By fostering a culture of global cooperation and rapid sharing of solutions amongst the broader imaging community, we can transform radiological practice to mitigate its environmental impact, adapt and develop resilience to current and future climate and environmental threats, and simultaneously improve access to care.",Canadian Association of Radiologists journal = Journal l'Association canadienne des radiologistes,2025,Rockall Andrea G; Allen Bibb; Brown Maura J; El-Diasty Tarek; Fletcher Jan; Gerson Rachel F; Goergen Stacy; Marrero González Amanda P; Grist Thomas M; Hanneman Kate; Hess Christopher P; Ho Evelyn Lai Ming; Salama Dina H; Schoen Julia; Sheard Sarah,,10.1177/08465371251321390,40007055,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40007055/

The recent re-emergence of Oropouche virus (OROV) has added complexity to vector control strategies, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches to curb arboviruses spread. We aimed to analyze temporal trends and spatial distributions with national scope of these emerging arboviruses. An ecological study using data from the Brazilian Notifiable Diseases Information System the period from 2023 to 2024 was undertaken. Temporal trends were evaluated using Joinpoint regression, while spatial analysis was conducted using Moran's I, and local indicators of spatial association. Dengue fever cases increased by 322%, while Oropouche fever (OF) increased by 300%. The states of Amazonas and Espírito Santo reported increases in OF cases. Moran's I test revealed spatial clustering of DENV and CHIKV. Two municipalities in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul showed cocirculation of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV. This study identified a surge in arbovirus cases between 2023 and 2024, with peak incidences from January to March and October to December, linked to favorable climatic conditions.

PubMed,Safety and Efficacy of Influenza Vaccination in Kidney Graft Recipients in Late Period After Kidney Transplantation.,"Influenza is a viral infection affecting up to 20% of the general population annually. Solid organ transplant recipients have a higher morbidity and mortality risk, as well as a greater likelihood of severe disease complications. Vaccination against the influenza virus is a safe and recommended prophylaxis; however, immunosuppression and high comorbidity burdens impair the immune response. We assessed the efficacy, safety, and humoral response to influenza vaccine in a population of kidney transplant recipients (KTx). Adult KTx recipients at least 6 months post-KTx were divided into vaccinated (vKTx) and non-vaccinated (nvKTx) groups based on consent for vaccination. The vKTx group received one dose of quadrivalent split virion inactivated vaccine (Vaxigrip Tetra Sanofi Pasteur). Subjective symptoms and side effects were recorded in paper journals. Antibody levels were assessed with ELISA prior to and 3 months following vaccination. Serum creatinine and proteinuria were assessed prior to vaccination as well as 3 and 6 months after. Of 450 recruited KTx recipients, 91 in the vKTx group and 36 in the nvKTx group of comparable age, KTx vintage, and graft function were included in the study. Graft function and proteinuria remained stable in both groups. The vKTx group experienced no severe adverse events. The most common complaints were general malaise (20.5%) and injection site pain (10.3%).
